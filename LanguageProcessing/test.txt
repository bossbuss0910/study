This little app does a lot of work for you so you can jump start your creative juices. I love this app and highly recommend it.
I've only had the game for a few minutes and i cant figure out the controls. Please fix, but otherwise its awesome!
I worked and worked with this app trying to land the plane, both in &#34;cockpit&#34; mode and in &#34;airplane&#34; mode.  I succeedeed in a series of spectacular crashes.  That's all.  I really don't get it.
Perhaps my Kindle Fire is not downloading correctly, as there is no &#34;Jackpot&#34; to win, and there are no scores being given to me if and when I win a game.  You only play with one card at a time, no choices to play with more than one card per game.You have 89 seconds to play one game.  No voice is telling you the numbers.  The first number is printed out and you look for the number, pressing the number if is there.  If you see the number after you pressed to move forward, it does not allow you to fill it in.  Therefore, attempting to hit the number, having it tell you no, you have lost more seconds out of the 89 seconds you were given.When the card is done, no score is given.  You then have to hit the symbol to start the next game, not knowing if that is the number for this card or the last card, as it never has no number appearing to start another game.I would love an explanation given to me so I understand it is definitely my Kindle not doing something correctly, as well as me not understanding what it is I am simply not smart enough to figure out.  The person listed as the first reviewer should give explanation on why this is so much fun.I would love my money returned to my account, if possible.  This is a big reason why I do not believe in purchasing games.  Many times it is worthless.Thank you
I did not like it 1) the cares are very small 2 ) the game is boring 3) you get only two cares I is at the far corn the one is to far left corn  the numbers are showing  you after hit a bar in the mid for numbers but more then some of my numbers will not show that I hit the number . I would never tell anyone about this game.
Looks like a great game but can't read the small call ball  and it  is a dark colors  sorry I,m 75 and my friends and I need average size call balls . But good luck.
Five star app. I found it very soothing and it help calm my  mind as I do my five minutes breathing exercise during my busy work day. Very nice app. Thank for creating it. I will tell all my friend about your app. I have no complaints about this app.
Very hard to find the information that I was looking for and to follow. Was hard to put in the city that I was researching the weather on. This app just not for me.
My 3 year-old loves this book and enjoys reading the stories over and over again. Very happy with the purchase.
Keeps my two year old busy. He especially likes the races and popping the balloons. The puzzles he still needs help with occasionally even on the super easy setting.
It's impossible to tell whether it is working. It scans my Kindle HDX so quickly I am left wondering if it is actually accomplishing anything. I wish it had a screen or a display that gave some indication it has actually done its job.
My kids love the Dr. Seuss book collection. I am considering getting another collection for them. The big negative is the price, at $12. But compared to the physical books, it's not bad. I recommend this for children 2-5, maybe even older.
As many others have posted there is no way to add music from itunes to the player. Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews before i downloaded the app. DON'T waste your money!!
My son loves this app!  It has improved is dexterity and he loves to do the puzzles.  Of course getting my Kindle away from him can be a challenge.
Looks great on my Samsung galaxy. Only issue is I can't get wallpaper to load. Worked great at first, but won't come up.if it wasn't for that id give it 6 stars
I have a Kindle Fire and I expected this optimizer to enable my Kindle to charge faster. It still takes about four hours to charge. Similarly, I expected that the optimizer would extend the time between charges. I doesn't seem to have done that either. I don't know whether my network connection is any better, nor do I know whether the Spyware Scanner and/or the virus scanner has actually done anything. In hindsight, I should not have purchased this item.
Does not do what I was hoping to have.would like to get money back.feature Iwad needed is unavailable for kindle
At first I was worried about the difficulty and I had struggles, this game is somewhat unbalanced I had to tip the balance in my favor but with buying the 1000 HP and 300 SP accessories (Not telling the names so to not spoil the game) and using soul points to power up my characters I am able to play this game somewhat better. I had struggles with Sein especially, he/it had a lot of hp which is out of balance UNLESS you're not meant to win that battle, it's tough. I suggest you level up to 27 before you take him on.This game could use an update to balance out the party vs bosses. The Dragon demon you fight after that battle as a subsequent sidequest in that fort is a lot easier and it gives you more exp than Sein.I have yet to complete the games, I think that if they had cloud saves through Live (Microsoft) would make their games more enjoyable because you can preserve your game saves in case of something like a corruption occurs or you want to play this across devices.  I lost over 80 hours of game play across their games due to catastrophic losses.Update 1:I have gotten a little further in the game, I spent another $4.99 in-app to buy some notes to buy rare items, and got a exp doubled ring. (Not that I do not know the name I do not want to spoil the game) And this game is moer fun now I am at the level I should be for the area I am in. I am at Porto Town now and this is where I have stopped for the day, and I enjoyed the challenge of locating something for a little kid, the story is getting better as I go along, first I thought it was a little bland, with the last part it started to get interesting. I hope when I make it to the place that is the goal so far it will start to be epic so to speak.Enjoy, the nostalgia level is 7.25/10.Story so far 7.5/10Nostalgic Graphics 7/10More to be added as I go along watch this review
I have no idea what this game consist of. I was told to rate it to have the hint button recharge quicker.
My grand daughters love this game! The kindle is the first thing they ask for when they come to Nana's so they can play Doc McStuffin.
First, as far as safety is concerned, the app downloaded and was scanned by Lookout and found not to contain any spyware. - 1 star!There were no in app purchases that I could find! - 1 more star!You may at this point notice a total of two stars in the review.... that is because the game play itself is definitely not one I plan to use again. The front page opens with a menu of topics - but the language is not standard US English and it appears to have several areas where the words were mistranslated. For example, when you select a topic, you can choose from Adjectives, Verbs, Animals, and Substantives. OK, in law, "substantives" is used to explain the topic of "nouns" but why are Animals not part of the noun category?  A bit confusing, but something I could get used to, I guess.Then there is the set of directions, a button labeled "How it's played." The game is summarized in two sentences and the word "then" is incorrectly used instead of "than." Admittedly, I don't really need much to know how to play, but it is still disconcerting that a game designed to help with vocabulary does not know correct grammar.Next, there are buttons on the main page that give you an option to send an email with directions in a language I don't recognize. Another button sends you to the Google Play web site to buy the game --- if you bought it here, why is this necessary? A third button takes you to the Facebook page for the developer, but I couldn't see it properly on my Kindle Fire HD. I'm not sure why. This seems to be a game that was almost a free giveaway then changed at the last minute to be a single purchase game.During the game, you have the ability to select any letter, consonant or vowel as one of your guesses. If you are correct, the letter appears in the grid above the hangman image. If you are incorrect, you see more of the skeleton. I played the game several times and won a few and lost a few. I was rather annoyed that, if you do not solve the puzzle, you are not told what the word was. I also didn't like the message -"Damn it, they hanged you!" I can just see my teens telling me this phrase is acceptable since it is used in the game "for all ages." The idea that the character is a skeleton and not an 8 bit man is a bit strange enough, but I would really prefer to see at least the ending comment edited. Finally, if you win, you are given a "Congratulation" instead of a "Congratulations."The minor qualms I have with the game play theme, though, are nothing to the concerns I have with the overall language issues of this app. As a result, I would not recommend a purchase of it.
I first downloaded the free app to see what it did.  It was a hit with my three year old daughter and she wanted the complete game.  It's teaching her how to write letters.
Wonderful ! 3 year old LOVES this. He is having FUN and LEARNING!Great Illistration, wonderful color and Interactive !
Looking for an enjoyable point and click adventure with great graphics, clear HOS, easy mini games, and an appropriate amount of dialogue?  Then this is the game for you.  Looking for a complicated mystery and storyline?  Then not so much.  Still, I enjoyed this game.  The hint button was a little slower than in other games I have played, but the map was invaluable if not fully interactive.  I only wish the game had been longer or that there was a bonus chapter for the price.  Of course if you purchase now you receive 80 bit coins.  Good job overall.
I received a press release on this new app available and was initially hesitant to request for a review copy as I was afraid that Ben might be too young for this app. Of course, I do believe teaching should start when children are young and so after thinking through again, I decided to request for this app hoping that there will be no issue for me in reviewing it despite the age constraints. To my surprise, Cathy from Oceanhouse Media replied with the promo code to download the app for free saying "It's never too early to begin teaching kids about the meaning of money :-)". Yes!Ben was engrossed and captivated with the illustrations shown. He pointed out things he's familiar with, like family spending time together and the need to work regardless whether the job is fun or tiring and so on.What's good?* We can closely relate to the illustrations shown as it is more real-life (as in not cartoonish looking which might not be able to send a strong message to the young ones).* I love the app! Even as an adult, I learned from reading this book too!* My 28 month-old toddler is learning and applying what he learned from this book!To be honest, after going through this book, I realized why Ben is telling us this sentences nowadays "Ben-ben buy", "Ben-ben pay money" and "Another one" (as in don't buy this on impulse, just wait for another better one!).Yes, my 28 month-old toddler says all these sentences lately! All thanks to this book! I'm happy he doesn't go around saying 'Daddy buy for me' or 'Daddy pays for me' or 'Daddy buy now!' and so on and  the fact that he knows he's responsible and has to decide if he wants something and not just rely on other people to provide for him.What's not so good?* Nothing that I can think of!
Product would not run on my Android 4.0 tablet. Kept getting error report So I simply uninstalled it. Sorry .
It's a amazing game I love it this game is the bomb I love the gameplay and it looks cool
This game is pretty fun, there is not a definite goal but just a little puppy exploring in outer space, I would recommend this game for kids 2 or 3 years old
Other than being overpriced,  there really isn't anything wrong with the game.  There is a decent storyline, with a villain, and a lady in distress.There are several different mini-puzzles, all with skips available.  Hints recharge  quickly, too, which is good 'cuz there is no zoom.The music is great, with several different pieces featuring guitar that I really liked.  The right music can do so much to set a mood.There were a few objects that were covered by the item list. I used the hint to find them, and tapped THROUGH the list and was able to pick them up.Played ok on my Kindle Fire 2nd gen.Not a difficult game.  I would recommend to folks not looking for a huge challenge.
I like the game ok. It got good theme and character but the gameplay be a little more original. It wants you spend lots coin only gripe
Just sat down and finished this game after picking it up other day why did I wait? Going through it again right after I write this review.
It is a lot of fun to play and is challenging!  I really like it better than Candy Crush!  I highly recommend it!!!
This game is mad fun. it's nothing major you wont build a city after playing this game. but it's great for passing some time.
As soon as I got this game, it was corrupted.  I immediately got on Mayday and the representative helped me get it off my tablet. Now, I am leary of Anarchy Enterprises' games. This is the 1st time this has happened to me. It will probably be a long time before I download anything fro Anarchy Enterprises. :-( I was really looking forward to playing this game. :-(
My kids love this app and it keeps my 2 year old entertained!!!  She loves finding the animals and her 4 year old sister likes showing her all the neat extras, like picking apples or making pinecones fall off the trees
Just like story, funny, fun:D  I love the graphics.  weapons are pretty cool too, because they actually have to do with the show.
Use this for the granddaughter's first grade practice.  She learned how to use it in a couple of minutes and now she practices her addition and subraction.  We especially like the number range selection where we can choose the range of numbers she is learning.  Right now she is limited to numbers under 10.
I sent an e-mail, like the site requests. I explained that many shows are not able to view.  I had no reply from the site.Some of the movies are good, others (except for the no shows) are drab and in the wrong sections. I clicked on Drama and watched a comedy that was in the Drama section.
This Batteries provides all I need for a Batteries Indicator:+ Battery widget on Home Screen+ Show battery percentage on Notification Bar+Include all important information about battery(including: battery percentage, battery health status, estimated remaining time or time since unplugging)in pull-down notification bar+ Enough configuration for battery icons, appeareances and content to display.
Its Perry. Everyone loves Perry :) cool game and addictive. The only thing that sucks is u must be on wifi or have an internet connection to play.
This is a combo of graphic novel and HO game.  There isn't any point-and-click adventure, or quest of any kind.  Not even any mini-games.  I prefer games that are heavy on adventure and light on HO.  These HO scenes  seemed really cluttered.  I found them tedious.  If the game hadn't been so short, I don't think I would have finished it. The game is over over-priced for the length and quality.There is another 'Hide and Secret' game, with the same two weird looking characters on it's thumbnail.  That game is much better than this, if you need a little more that straight HO.  'Treasure of the Ages'  is for those folks who want strictly HO.  Played on Kindle Fire 2nd gen. w/o any problems.
My 18 month old son loves this app! It's very easy for him to navigate and he gets such a kick out of seeing what sounds he can make when he goes crazy tapping his little fingers on the screen. Very worth the price and just plain fun to play and watch your little one play. A+ toddler app!
I really like this app. I have found a bunch of uses for it.It allows me to setup and send work document from my laptop to my tablet and read them on my commute home. I also discovered it is the easiest way to sync the family pictures I want with me at all times. I keep finding additional ways to use this and not having my documents & pictures off on someone's server cloud makes me feel like it is best thing for me. I did need to purchase the Windows version for the laptop to make it all work right but that was no big deal and well priced for a one-time buy solution. Thanks!
I love it as much as my son.  Definitely worth the purchase...a little bit of wholesome fun for the whole family!
The first levels are a bit too easy, but the game gets more difficult after that. Good quality product and not very expensive for a real 3D game. highly recommend.
I initially got this app because of the Sherlock Holmes content after I washed all the Sherlock Holmes I found myself going back to this app to watch other programs it's a great little app
it's relly cute!!!I play it every day!you should try it.you can dress your puppy!it even gives 16 dogs!you can even change the backround
An ok game, especially if you get it for free. The painting puzzles are ridiculously hard, you have to find a certain brush stroke in a painting that has maybe 3 different hues. It's like finding a needle in a haystack and not very fun. The Mahjong-ish puzzles are pretty fun but get very repetitive.
Thought this might be fun to look into, very disappointing.  I need 6 more words to submit--computer now satisfiednothing here...move along...move along
Worth the price of purchase. Has a good selection of the cartoons that you were raised on.  Especially Tex Avery is worth a look.
Kids love this game. This is always their go to game when they use my phone.  It's a good game.
In my opinion, this is the BEST karaoke app. Unlike others, there is no need to purchase each individual song or artist. And I'm not exactly sure how often, but there are regular updates that add more songs to sing. Overall, this is one of those MUST HAVE apps for everybody who likes to sing!
My problem is not with the work, but with myself.  It was downloaded to my Kindle Fire HD, and at the time I wanted to use it, my email site was corrupted and I was unable to direct my Kindle to another email site.
this app would not or could not download or open so I really don't know if it is a good game or not . I am not sure that it is compatible with my kindle fire .
Please ignore how odd the people look in the thumbnail.  I thought a game that had such a cheesy look couldn't be any good.  I was wrong again.If you use the map, as another reviewer stated, it will take you directly where you want to go.  Has a great zoom for the HO scenes, which weren't huge.  I find a lot of HO scenes to be tedious.  These didn't seem so bad to me.  A few mini-puzzles, too.Graphics were ok, and the MUSIC WAS AMAZING!!!  Really went with the setting.This isn't a difficult game, and there is an on-line walkthrough.  I was making the game lots harder than it actually was.  Played ok on Kindle Fire 2nd gen.  Not terrific, but not a bad game.
I love the app it's really fun to make a minecraft skin and it has a 3d spin of your skin , A upload and download skins from your camera and has unlimited skin slots. I would give it 10 stars if I could.
My little daughter loves to play this game.We have been many times in Spain by holydays and we really like the spanish food.Thanks this game my daughter knows a little bit more about their gastronomy while she is playing.
Not compatible with Motorola droid.Tried every combination of settings wit no success. Give it a try for other makes.
I just love Toga Boga; I can't stop playing it!I also love Tocantins Hair Salon 2. Buy Toga Nova games.
Found this app on a list of best apps for toddlers. Totally adorable and tons of fun. Great animation and if your child loves silly sounds and funny characters, this is one for you. Plan to get their music box app as well since we are so impressed with the quality of this one. Overall, really love this open ended game and think the developer has a great feel for entertaining little ones.
I really like this game.  It's got great controls and the levels are quick but challenging. The graphics are nice looking and have little details that I love. You certainly can't go wrong here and I highly recommend this game if you enjoy platforms even a little bit.
My girls love Jake. We first played this app at our local library. I saw it here and had to get it for my Kindle. It keeps them busy and entertained. Definitely worthy of buying. It's not that expensive either.
My 20 mo old enjoys it,cute melodies and funny little things you make happen.I would recommend for any toddler, very easy to use and entertaining.
Downloaded app out of curiosity. Yes, the movies are old, but since I also am old, I find them quite enjoyable. Current day movies offer so much more because of all the technical advances in movie making, yet the movies of yesteryear are so much more enjoyable, for me at least, because the actors really could and had to be able to at least act. So, if you truly do enjoy old movies, this is a great app to see some of them.
No review.
Just downloaded this app for my Android device and it's awesome! Can't wait to use it on my upcoming trip to New York. This seems like a really interesting way to learn the city and its history!
I really enjoyed this game. The graphics and story was also interesting. I did not get bored with the game at all. It does have hidden object games but it is not over loaded with them. There was only one flaw that confused me and that was the library and the spirit of the librarianwas recorded in the journal before I was able to get into the library. Other than that I really enjoyed the game and I would definitely recommend it.
Never worked after the second day I used it now it says no results found 1i search I cannot ever have used it as a music player it forces close. I pay $10 for this app hoping that I could use the music player portion and the features that offered for their music player I thought was great right now I have a an app that I spend $10 for and I can't use it at all please help me. Right now it's not worth even one star I: would be very happy to upgrade to a full five star once I get the full function of this programi
I love love love this series. I do hope it continues. The graphics are great. I like the characters. Although some of them have a monotone speech, but you get over it. But loved playing it. Can't wait for the next episode.
I liked the first &quot;Mirror Mysteries&quot; a lot.  I liked this up to a point--the point when the game ended waaay too soon!The game is good--graphics are gorgeous, the music is good, voiceovers, too.  HO scenes with a twist, mini-games, good hints/skips.  Just not enough of any of it.Especially for $4.99.  Some of us are willing to fork over that much if we're assured of getting a good game of decent length.  It seems like most (all?) new releases are priced at $4.99 lately.  Some of these are seriously overpriced.  This is one of them.  The game is great. The value stinks.  Played on Kindle Fire 2nd gen.
There was a strange delay in the download which made me wonder, then when I got it there is so much similar to Photo Editor that it just doesn't seem worth it if I can't get the extra filters advertised inside the app.  Which when I try to download send me straight to the Amazon store main site ( and still no download ) and then the whole app won't open for quite a while.  This shouldn't happen for a ten dollar app.  Be Funky has better filters and so does Photo Editor.  The app is very straight forward and intuitive and I don't like whiners on here that just complain to complain, but something just isn't working.
I was really excited to play but kindle fire I just keep getting booted out after a minute  of play, erased and reloaded a bunch of times but still the same, won't play
I purchased this for the wi-fi sync capability and the ability to import my old (insecure) password list directly into the secure password 360 database. Now I can keep my passwords in sync between my phone, table, and laptop. When I had questions, the developer was quick to respond.
Don't get it. This sort of thing happens quite frequently. If you tap quickly more than three times, the game freezes and then you have to back out of the game and restart it. I can not get any further because I can not get the marbles mini game completed to open a door. Quite frustrating since I paid full price for the game and was assured that it would work glitch free on my Kindle Fire HDX. If I can figure out how to get this fixed and I can complete the game, I will edit my ranking.
I will try to get my money back for this app. I have no idea what the great reviews were about, but hit the &quot;save&quot; icon and lost everything I had been working on, typed in a term to bring it up and nothing, went into about, no words of wisdom there, waste of time and money.
The  latest TB game is their best yet. The exodus has ended, and the must lead the Star Traders factions to survival. Survive in a harsh unexplored corner of the void. Build a powerful economy and settle the internal conflicts of the factions, all while beating back the relentless attacks of the Xeno. Can you bring stability and safety to a shattered race?Features:1:Lead three factions. Chose Syndicates or Great houses,each with their own  advantages.2:Rediscover the lost technology of the Star Traders with an extensive tech tree.3:Colonize new worlds.4:Build a strong infrastructure and economy, with colony .  .  upgrades from  habitation units and mines to wealthy trade exchanges and palaces.5:Use espionage and politics to keep the factions old  .  hatreds from consuming them.Influence conflicts like trade disputes, assassin duals, solar wars and spy wars.6:Use rediscovered tech to retrofit your fleet anyway you want, then use them to protect your empire against the Xeno.Cons: Other than a difficulty curve, none! Bugs are quickly fixed and the developers are dedicated to their craft. This is one of the best games on the market.
This might have been a fairly nice game, but I'll never know since after you exit and then re-enter, you get a black screen with the frame around it. Tried several downloads, but still did not work! $5 is way too much for a game that hasn't been de-bugged! Don't bother until they fix it.
soo many other  apps that are far more easy to learn from...give more info than this one.but thank you for making it free so others  can try it!
I thought I could manage this game but I was wrong. I'm no good at this. Ill stick to my H.O.G. puzzles.
I purchased the Pro version thinking that it had wi-fi sync. I was wrong. However, the developer was very helpful pointing me to the Password 360 Plus version as the one I needed and helped my acquire it.
works but too much work to set address book, and does not give you a choice of what route you want to take.
This app requires access to your location via GPS service and boots automatically when you turn your phone on. No thanks spyware!
Full disclosure before I start - I got my hands on this by working for Broken Crayon Games (publisher of the game).Never the less, it's really addicting game that I've actually kept on my phone after publisher (usually they go on the phone for testing and then are deleted off).  Anyway, I kept this one around as a time-killer.  It's one of those games that doesn't make you think for hours to get it right (like Candy Crush), nor do you have to think on the fly too much (like Tetris).  If you can make basic color association and pop the balls when they smile at you -- you can play this game and increase your finger reaction speeds (lol helpful in my industry).Best of all, you give this to a kid and it keeps them occupied.  Each round is quick and simple, and yet it's still fun!
All you really do is pick a color of a cake and decorate it. You can't be creative at all. I'm so disappointed.
I got these apps free from Amazon's deals. All the apps made by this dev has very bad privacy invading permissions!!!! Why do they make these apps with sp ICJ pwrmisions especially for kids beyond me! I will TOTALLY remove it from even my cloud!!!
Do not pay for this app!  I posted a review earlier today for this app along the same lines as GemDragon's review and it has not &#34;gone live&#34;.  On today's date, 7/2/14, this app was free but listed as being normally 99cents.  IT HAS ADS!!  I hope people aren't actually paying for this version of the app.  This version is the free version that is in another app store (GP--I typed that store name in my review--so maybe that's why it did not post).  This deception does not bode well with me.  From using it for a while today, it is probably a useful app.  But don't bait us thinking we are purchasing a full version app only to then find out it is not the full version of the app.  Paid apps should not contains ads.  I won't duplicate what GemDragon typed (6/24/14)--read their review as well--I agree completely.  I too do not trust the key to open the full app for the additional 2.99 will remove permissions either.....it's a key, not an app purchase.I generally only take the time to leave reviews when something is extremely great or extremely bad. On occasion I leave a review when, IMHO, something deserves a review for one reason or another.  Hours later I am still annoyed that, as it stands right now, this app is listed as normally costing 99cents, when it is not the full app but a version that is free from other sources.
Worked just fine the first time i launched it but now just sits there with a black screen.  Tried reinstalling but had the same problem, worked just fine the verry first time but after closing the app, it wont reopen.  But the game is totally awesome, just wish i could play again.  Xoom
This game is so awesome. But I think you should only get this app if you have seen a lot of shows or movies
We can't apply the makeup and we have so little portions of makeup I am never plying this game again
Permissions needs to be changed! All apps from Nutty Apps has really bad permissions for kids games. WHY? Please remove them. This suppose to be paid apps and has loads of spyware/ad-ware on ALL their apps. Cannot play the apps cause of these permissions. I hope dev can change these horrid apps so kids can go ahead and play them and I can change my reviews to what these apps deserve!
This is a single player &#34;word-find&#34; game for lack of a better description.  However, even though it's single player, I challenge coworkers to get a higher score than me OR, what we've actually found more fun since I have a Samsung Note (one of the large phones) we put the phone in between us and play the &#34;Action&#34; mode that is like 'speed rounds' sort of.
Full disclosure before I start - I got my hands on this game because I work for Broken Crayon Games (the publisher of the game).Anyway, the developer says it's more geared toward kids, but honestly it's so challenging!  I'm an adult (lol maybe that puts me at a disadvantage), but honestly this game is hard for me to beat the levels at times!  Definitely a fun game to get you're color memory going because in order to make the time limits you have to remember where you've been collecting certain colors around the globe so you turn the right way or else you're toast and have to start again!
I likr the concept but I wish there was more to do. its just making shirts and shorts....fun when your board though.
Really REALLY fun game! Challenging too and it keeps me occupied for hours. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fun way to pass the time!
My granddaughter loves it. IT keeps her busy . And she loves the designs that she makes
First of all, the description in the app gives the web address of nuttyapps with the /privacypolicy as the address for viewing the policy, and that is non-existent.  The website nuttyapps exists.  The privacy policy link in the app seems to lead to a /#privacy suffix after the nuttyapps web address, so let's establish that you won't get to the privacy policy via the dev's instructions.Second, the description implies that they actually care about privacy issues that it shouldn't be a concern for you if you download this app.  I actually read the privacy policy, and it's basically the same wording as you'd find in the apps that do NOT respect privacy issues and ones we typically label &#34;spyware infused.&#34;  Basically, this app has the same permissions like fine location wifi (knows exactly where your house or you are located) that we generall should steer clear of in a PAID APP. (Today, it was free as a special, and methinks I now know why, when you add it to the apps actual play content below).Third, look at the graphics (and graphics from their other &#34;kids&#34; apps).  This may be because the developer as a main address in Pakistan, and they are of different cultural upbringings, but I can't imagine a parent in the USA loading an app for their toddler that this picture of a LITTLE TINY KID with a black eye, a hanging needle-stick in some kind of cyst, and cuts and wounds all over their face that then states A CLUMSY DOCTOR DID IT!  What a way to comfort a child who has visit doctors!  This is not a &#34;patient adventure,&#34; but more of a way to give a kid nightmares and a permanent physician phobia!I think too may devs these days are trying to capitalize on the ever-popular Dr. Panda series, of which they too have a hospital/treatment app.  But that app just puts a scope in a pet's ear, a bandaid on a pet, etc., and the animals don't go IN looking like they had a bad day of interrogation by some rogue cops!!This is an EPIC FAIL on so many levels that I'm surprised such graphics of CHILDREN made it through the Amazon filtering system.  Considering I'm the only reviewer thus far to review it, and possibly to have downloaded it (only because it was free and I was curious), I have a lot more faith now in the Amazon PARENT filtering system of what they choose to BUY for their kids.
this is the worst game ever i mean if i could give this zero stars i would so im telling you now  save yourself the trouble.
This game stinks don't buy it you don't get to do anything they show or say you just sit their and watch. Please trust me I spent 99 coins on this awful game. Don't get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!  :&quot;0
This app is horrible. It's too slow and every time I try to get on it it breaks down so DON'T GET IT
It's incredibly easy to lose track of contacts... Contacts U Pro seriously saved my sanity and helped me share contact info with friends, coworkers, and family members with ease. It runs incredibly smooth on my device and it's a great way to keep contacts backed up in case of &#34;whatever&#34;. Definitely recommended!!
this app was a total waste of time & money.  would not recognize my email account name and/or password.  totally worthless!
It's addictive! I play until my fingers are numb! I even use my brain! You will not be disappointed. Get this game.
Well made app just don't like how it opens a new window every time you look at something gor instance looking at all themobs will have  a bunch  of windows open one for each mob
I do recommend that you purchase this game. You get everything you see in the photos. And there are no glitches (as far as I can tell.) There I s just one flaw; the live action graphics. When you are painting with the colors, the graphics are amazing. But in the other mode, they are nothing special. If they could combine the live action graphics of the Atomus game and their paint mode, it would be one of the best games on here. That is my only complaint. I hope this review helps.
bate this game my daughter tried to turn it on but it just came up as face book accounts and would not load.
I really liked the levels in which you can start using,then work your way up. I had just started using my tablet and it was really a change from my large screen,s so the moving the pieces where the most challenging.This puzzle game has a lot of pictures to choose from and excellent institutions to help. They also have helped me when it would have technical problems,which I think is super great.They have different levels you can advance to at your own pace. I have really enjoyed this puzzle game and think anyone that love doing puzzles would,best of all you can't drop your piece and not ever find it,it's always there somewhere.
Great for all that enjoy puzzles.hours of fun and a great killing time app. Try it you will enjoy it.
The pictures are stunning, I love the variety of scenes and their depth. Would definitely get more apps like this one.
This is like Temple Run only its brave. You have to run away from a bear. But don't run into stuff of the bear can eat you. And stay away from the water. This game has powers.
Another great hidden object game from tamalaki.  We snatched up almost all of them at the sale prices.  Tons of different ways to play this game!
Hearts is a very entertaining game.  My only complaint is that the computer tends to make sure you do not win.  It is not fun loosing all the time.  Well, I guess you can't say loosing all the time because sometimes you come in second or third.  Other than that, you keep playing to see if you can win.Spades is a fun game to play.  Playing partners works well.  The play is true to life.  No complaints with spades.
So I was browsing and I saw this, and thought to myself... Nice premise, cute art, looks interesting! I'm glad to say that I was right. The art is well done and the puzzles are fun to solve, with a bunch of cool mechanics making every puzzle different. The boss level steps it up a bit as well. Overall highly recommended!
Only b/c ZERO stars isn't an option. Can't believe I paid for this.  It simply doesn't work.  Impossible for anyone to give it even a couple of stars if the damned thing won't even launch.  Total rubbish.
Love &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 !
It it not the best app I have seen better apps then this.not a good appDo not waste your time
Just as with the first, this game was very fun and challenging (although a little more challenging than the first.) It has a different style than the first, making it a unique experience. I enjoyed every level and loved how they made me think. So far, so good! Excited to play the third!
It is the best temple run!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!you should by it it is not that boring I hope you will love it to!
I like this much more than I thought I would.  It's a little repetitive, but that repetition helps you develop strategy as you play the game.  Every so often you get a new animal to use in your fight against the lumber jacks, and you get some new weapons or special items.  That makes it fun to mix it up a little.

Difficult to work. When trying to move one piece, any that are touching it move with it. It takes a very fine touch to prevent this, which I do not have. Perhaps a stylus with a fine point would help.
While the game is fun to play, there isnt much to it.  I was expecting more levels and there isn't any.  After about 2 hours I was done and removed it from my kindle.
This was a fun puzzles it has differnt modes you can use like easy, regular, hard and hardest. I like all the different animals pictures if you like puzzles this is the one for you. gives you plenty of picture to put together.
hours of fun and levels with plenty of challenges to go thou. highly recommended to anyone who wants value for the money
I'm not getting how this could teach a child learn to practice tracing, I've been looking all over for a good tracing app, this is the dumbest yet, stars float everywhere, what's the point?
I really enjoy working these puzzles.  Because of all the options, you can make them more difficult or in my case easier.  They creators are great and the customer service awesome.  I highly recommend this puzzle and all their other puzzles as well.
These games seem to be a hit with my Grand Children so when asked, I agreed to purchase it. My Grand Daughter didn't play it for long which surprised me. After she left I kept hearing music so I picked up my kindle to make sure it was off and found it to be this game. I played it to see if the music would turn off or I could END the game, but I can't get it to stop. The game itself is horrible with totally unappealing characters. The games to make the patient well are so simple and unappealing that they didn't even keep my 5 year old entertained. Now I have to try to delete this to get the music and now a strange annoying sound to stop. DON'T BUY THIS GAME !
not worth the cost, they should pay you to take it. Should be -5 stars
Because the book keeps my son's attention. Also has many of his sight words in the book. It makes me happy to see my son enjoying reading on the go
Have been experiencing responsiveness problems for purchased and free puzzles of late. Tried removing from Kindle and reinstalling. No luck. Very annoying experience s of late. Wondering w h at gives.
The information provided is accurate but lacking.  It would get the other two stars if it explained why the remedies worked.
I have only used this app once and I LOVED it. Love the crescendo feature on it. Nothing bad on the app! Works great on the LG Ally!
Game Studio Tycoon is rather unabashedly inspired by Game Dev Story.  I really want to like this game, however it seems its not quite ready for primetime.  While trying to emulate Game Dev Story, the developers seem to have lost the joy that GDS provided.There are numerous small little issues, no way to really pause the game, time passes while you're trying to start a new project, no speed control.  This makes the game a hectic affair, to the point of being almost TOO fast.  Most time I don't even try naming my games, because the loss of time from typing in a name can be a few weeks in-game time; never mind selecting a system or a Genre.Developing that unnamed game isn't a whole lot better.  Feedback is limited to the 4 reviews you get upon a games release, and sales figures; you get no indication if the Genre and Type of game (Say Cartoon Action) is a bad match, or a good match, or even if it has any effect at all.  While this sytem could add another layer to gameplay, without any indication of what works and what doesn't this system is completely wasted.  It would be great if genres had their time in the sun, such as &#34;Epic RPGs are hot right now!&#34;, or &#34;Military Shooters aren't selling.&#34;  It would be even greater if you could improve your base skill with a particular Genre, as this is a pretty standard practice in the game development industry.  (Treyarch doesn't make Fantasy RPG's for example).I cannot speak for the later part of the game, as I never got there.  I had barely moved into my second office when I essentially hit a wall.  I couldn't make sales figures large enough to pay my bills, even though I felt like my game &#34;stats&#34; were very good.  The aformentioned lack of feedback played heavily here.  The game is simply too hard, with zero explaination.  If I die in a Mario game, I know it's because I walked into an enemy.  Here I fail, but with absolutely no indication of why.The small things that GDS did; letters from fans, comdex convention, and the employee &#34;special projects&#34; are missing here.  The game is very sterile and consequently, there's almost no personality. In the end, you are left with the feeling that Kairosoft better get to porting GDS2.  There's hope for GST, with continued updates, I can see this game rising above it's problems; but I just cannot reccommend the game in it's current form.Note:I do believe there's also a bit of developer difficulty here, due to GST's rather singular development.  Without an outside perspective, it's very easy to make your game far, far too hard for the audience.  As a developer, you want your game to be challenging; however, you've spent hundred of hours in the code, you know how it works intimitely and the game is too &#34;easy&#34;, you compensate by making the game harder.  In this process, you raise the bar very high unknowingly, and end up alienating your audience.  It's very common among small/single development houses.
Once pics. So far, no hanging up issues that have been problematic with other puzzles. Have not tried beyond regular difficulty, which has been an issue with other puzzles. Try this one.
An amazing Android App for SMS. It appears as a popup window so that you can read, reply sms even when you are watching film, music...
- Quick & Accurate computation for FV, PV, PMT, Interest Rate, Period. Highly recommended for simple & efficient TVM Calculator.
I was there very recently and then i saw this fun jigsaw puzzle,  it brings back so many memories of istanbul!  I can't wait to go back.  If your a fan of jigsaw puzzles and istanbul you wont find a better game than this.
I have not had a chance to really use this, but from what I see it's a very good tool.
This is a great game and a lot of fun to play. A huge drawback is that even when I exit the game fully, it still runs in the background, and also keeps the appstore app open. I've also done forcestops on both several times, but they show up again after a couple of minutes. I've already had to uninstall this from my phone because I didn't want it vampiring my battery. Will be contacting tech support.
Seemed OK.. Just has been done before. Probably fun for a kid.If I had actually paid for it, instead of getting it as the app of the day.. I would have been way more upset.
I do the hard puzzles which are fun and challenging. I like animals. I try to improve my time each time.
Picture are stunning....puzzle was impossible to work with.  Had problems with the puzzle itself loading.  I Got very frustrated and finally just deleted.
It is really fun to play.  I really like it.  Love that the objects revolve around and you have to keep up with them.
Actually it simple app but very useful one. It scans all installed apps and point out which app(s) is wpyware, which app(s) steal personal information without our consent.
There is a website called wigflip.com in which you can do the same thing as you do on this. If you use PicCollage you can also format a picture to add the speech bubble. This is pointless money to waste ^ - ^
An fantastic Android App for SMS. It appears as a popup window so that you can read, reply sms even when you are watching film, music, playing game...
Works on my Fire TV and my android devices.ProsVery fun, easy to use good graphicsConsThe controls can be a little bit difficult at fist but not a big deal over all.
Mediocre
This has to be the most useless app yet. It does not do anything but save locations. You can not then do anything with that info.
All you have to do for easy access of wifi or data is to make a shortcut for it on your screen. It's built into your android device! Why would you pay for an icon? Seriously? WHY?
I enjoy having this app on my device, the old Fire.  It is fun to discover new knots, what they are used for, and how to tie them.  I've recommended it to a couple of friends that work in Scouting.
I just got through watching 13 parts of season 1of under the dome..I had no problems ..never was sent to any other website it was all one click for me. And it all worked great on my kindle fire &amp; there's so many series to chose from..well. worth the money in my opinion ...don't listen to the haters ..try it yourself you'll be glad. you did!!!
I really am not sure!  I have tried it but?  I have tried to import contacts, hoping it would go to Outlook on my computer, asking to contact and import it in, but does not.  I did manage to import contacts on the Kindle but I got 4 copies of the same name because there is no button notice that they have been imported, do I want to replace any one or all.  Having to type out all the contacts again is a pain.  I already have them on the pc, make it possible to import so I can carry them with my when taking the Kindle with me, which I do.  beyond those, not to bad yet.
My husband and I both tried to make it work but it was just too complicated to use.  I am sorry we wasted our coins as I just deleted it.
i'm 60 years old but i still think farts are hysterical.  this app is great.  i have made many people at my job crack up when i walk around just pushing the different sounds.
Don't get this one it sucks, trust me!  The first one is better.  So pretty much ignore the five star rating.  It makes no sense to write something good about a crappy app.
Definitely like this &#8211; had other cat sound/ringtones app on old phone and it was nowhere near as good as this. Good graphics and easy to use and share sounds make it even better. Sounds are not just regular cat sounds&#62; these are unique for sure and funny too.
I play AD&D. I searched for hours looking for an app that had sound files that I could use during game play to add a little flavor and variety. I know several other gamers who are looking for the same thing.  Anyway, this was the closest I could find.  Even though Google Play's catalog is 1000x bigger than Amazon, they don't offer much either.  I'll likely just download wave files and make my own.  There's a goldmine to be had if someone actually comes up with one.
I thought it would be like action movie fxcause I couldn't get that app so I just wasted money
I am sure if you have little ones it would be fine.  I just misread and downloaded it out of curiosity. Have deleted it because I am an adult not a child.
I can write a note, but it does not display after I write it and there is no way for me to see the note anywhere after I write it. I bought it so I could write notes. Details need to be a little clearer. Waste of money.
Just downloaded and will not work. Program keeps telling me it stopped working - more like never started. Hopefully can get credit for purchase.
the manual does not contain enough information on cars that i have. it contains a little information concerning certain problems but not enuf.
There is no way to edit the documents or send them --and now I cannot return it. Get the notebook app: it's free and does everything this terrible app is supposed to do. AVOID!!!
