7.15  If you have never been there this is a pretty cheap tour and you don't have to worry about getting blown up  I found it interesting
7.19  This is a great price for one time viewing I decided to show this to my children's class at church BUT i hate that the screen titles are all in Spanish It must have been a dvd setting that wasn't changed before uploading to amazon However the audio is in English and it is a very well done exciting animated film
16.57  I must admit that I was one of the original kids in the late 's/ early 's who was obsessed with everything to do with VHS video stores and movies I even tried to persuade my parents into opening a video store it began my legit collecting obsession So I worked to buy used VHS moviesBy  I had well over  pre recorded movies Then in  DVD was introduced and unlike Blu Ray it was a game changer for me Over the course of the next  years I upgraded to DVD and while I knew many of my obscure VHS titles would probably never see the light of day due to either licensing agreements lack of popularity or whatever I was into DVD and quick and glad to abandon VHS and all of it's imperfections (drop outs frayed tape degraded picture with every viewing poor audio; nothing like a cat purring sound in surround horrible pan & scanned videos in glorious  lines of resolutionetc) A few dozen titles were never upgraded but with the help of technology and a DVD Recorder they were upgraded the labels and boxes were stripped and converted for use on the new personal/private DVD versionAs some of these titles have eeeked out in the past few years I then replaced those too I have been VHS free since  and there isn't a day that goes by where I lament the format that spurred my life's passionate hobby I doubt that people wish they could go back to black & white TV's anymore than I want to go back to that over sized & bulky  RCA  Head Mono VCR that sat in our living room on top of the console TV I have fond memories of those years but things are now better I am in agreement with a few of the people that were  interviewed that Blu Ray or "Boo Ray" as one guy put it sucks and is going to die outDVD still outsells Blu and at the end of the day it does comes down to "control of content" Blu Ray was a device created to prevent piracy control special features and to charge a little more per disc because DVD's copy protection was easy to circumvent and Wal Mart and other discount stores drove DVD's prices so low it made the DVD brand nearly worthless for the studios profit wise However there's a reason Blu Ray hasn't taken off despite hybrid combo packs and recent low prices - the format is greed and the public doesn't careAs far as the movie goes I thought it was just okay It spent way too much time veering off into sub subjects (Japanese culture people making their own home movies with a camcorder etc) that it didn't really keep me focused all the way though I did enjoy hearing about how mass merchants rejected art based covers from their store and tend to agree with the people in the film that part of the excitement of going to the video store and selecting videos was sometimes based solely on the box artwork But this was a small part in the film and just as it got interesting it got bland again Also there wasn't really any mention of the  supreme court case which ruled in favor of time shift recording while it kept hinting at that subject when talking about recordingThere was one small part where digital copies (like UltraViolet) are the next big thing and I also tend to agree because of the quality accessibility on multiple platforms and devices and the big NOW factor I am concerned as was another guy in the movie that again this could just be a control of content mess and after I myself did a little research and asked questions I discovered the following: Amazon of course unfortunately does NOT support the UltraViolet program so you do run the risk of having any digital video content become "unavailable" at a third party's discretionuntil said content is then renewed by Amazon I found this highly troubling and again as mentioned in the movie goes against the spirit of what it means to "purchase" something If something can be given and taken away you're just renting it So this is another medium that is either going to sink or swim based on user controlThis part resonated with me and it's why I have only  Amazon Digital movie titles and over  on Vudu with most being UltraViolet compatible Which btw is where I purchased and saw this movie (Rewind This) Last summer I had spoken to people at Vudu and mentioned Amazon's rd party position and asked what their policy was regarding purchased content vs it no longer being available to sell I was told several times that your purchased content and UV library is forever yours to view and download It just wouldn't be available for new people to rent or purchase So this helped me make my decision to take advantage of the UV digital copy wave; and I've been aggressively building this virtual library over the past  monthsSide note: If a title is UltraViolet compatible you can access it on multiple platforms like Roku PS X-Box most content enabled Blu Rays smart TV's Smart Phones or a computer through any of the participating UV partners (VuduCinemaNowTarget Ticket Nook Video M Go Flixster etc) providing said partner carries that title at their location Oh and accessing and watching your library on these platforms never costs a cent because it's your contentI recently had a chance to see this policy first-hand in December; I went to watch a few of my Christmas movies and went to search for "Surviving Christmas"(don't judge me I pay my billsand I happen to like the movie) Last Summer I had done a low cost disc to digital DVD to HDX upgrade on this tile The movie could not be found on Vudu "for sale or rent" nor on a few of the other UV partner sites(for whatever reason) but I checked my UV library titlesand sure enough the movie was there in my Vudu library so I immediately watched it UtraViolet purchased titles are in fact different from what's offered for sale on Amazon Digital You can download both for indefinite viewing but Amazon's Digital contracts suggest instability issuesIf I want to run the risk of movies disappearing on a whim I'd still be with Netflix This film (Rewind) didn't really get into that either though hinted at the topicThere's so many other things I want to banter on about and while I wanted to love this movie for it's geekiness history and delving into a world I'm so familiar with and love; I wanted to hear more stories from other true collectors and even strangers regarding their collecting and renting habits or even a mention of how Paramount first started renting their videos through Photo huts film kiosks where you'd get a catalog similar to the old Columbia House catalog and call and reserve a movie and then go pick it upThis is how I first saw Saturday Night Fever when I was  Howeverafter viewing Rewind This twice (had to view it again to be fair since I hated it the first time for being so touch and go) it just didn't hit a home run or even merit all of these good reviews There were too many cooks in the kitchen not enough experience or spice Rewind This left me feeling bland hungry and disappointed with it's many missed opportunities Another odd part was the guy who remembers the "be kind rewind" stickers as something warm It wasn't supposed to be cute it was so the next person renting didn't have to spend time doing what the previous person should have done Moreover those stickers usually said you were getting charged a buck per video if returning the video without rewinding it fees are so warm and cuteIt's nice to think about the past but the past is now the past however most of the same movies are still here and for the most part they look better than they ever did on VHS and that's the point The movies themselves remind me of the past not the crappy format That's where this film drops the ball We had HBO back in the early 's and the signal was really horrible but I never sit around wishing to watch Friday the th with snow and static all over the screen Nor does this movie make me want to hit the thrift stores flea markets and dirty junk piles for old VHS "gold" especially in a po dunk shacks charging $ or $ per VHS tape regardless of the title because some nostalgic saps who "love pan & scan movies over original aspect ratio versions" and think "DVD is broke 'cause it's got them black bars on the top and the bottom of my TV" or that VHS is like Vinyl - "it's gonna make a come back!" No no it's not but thanks have at it I'll gladly stick with DVD and UltraViolet
5.65  Great price for the product The design & acting is exactly what you would expect from a BBC version of this play produced at this time This gives you a great representation of the standard stage performance for this pieceGreat for an overview or research or just to familiarize yourself with some Shakespeare
15.77  Jonah and Kumail are great comics independent of each other but their chemistry on stage elevates both of them In coordination with Emily they're regularly booking the best stand-ups around and the minimalist nature of the show makes it incredibly cheap to produce Comedy Central would be unbelievably dumb not to keep giving this one the green light
17.33  There is a lot that I already knew about the major breweries holding a monopoly of the beer that's sold across the country  Just talk to any experienced bartender bar owner or liquor store manager and they will tell you pretty much the same thing this documentary did:  Anheuser-Busch and Miller control who sells what beers and where they are displayed in stores  A-B and Miller control % of the beer market and the smaller and better craft brewers are strugglingSo to gain the other  percent of the market marketers for A-B try to buy up the smaller brewers such as Rolling Rock  As one brewer said they buy up the smaller companies not so much for the beer but for the brand recognitionA few brands featured are Dogfish Beer and Yuengling all eastern beers but the story is pretty much the same across the country  When Congress allowed craft beers to be sold in the late s that is when A-B Miller and Coors started paying attention to the growing microbrewers that were springing up across the country  The Big Three were all about cheap beer with cheap adjuncts (a fine word for fillers such as rice and corn) whereas the finer craftbeers are more about real beer made the old-fashioned way with pure ingredients  This documentary featured one segment where several beer drinkers would mention their favorite beers but then couldn't tell one brand apart from the other during a taste test  People drink the national brands not for taste but out of habitAlthough I could say that this documentary could go into more detail about the wars between the Big Two and the smaller brewers and less about the woman beer entrepeneur the point is made  Distributors are controlled by A-B and Miller so if the regional distributor doesn't want to carry the smaller craft beers they can shut out the smaller brewers out quite easilyI discovered craft beers over ten years ago when I lived in New Jersey and can never go back to the national brands  The only time I buy Bud Lite is when I need a cheap fly attractant  Bud Lite has so much added sugars in its mixture that flies are attracted to the beer crawl inside the bottle or can and drown  You won't see as many flies be attracted to a high-quality craft beer as oftenSo enjoy this -minute documentary  Open your mind to real beer  Once you taste a real beer it's hard to go back to that stale Bud  You truly are what you drink
8.99  I rented the movie and loved it I'll be honestI half expected some of the typical ADV snobbery that usually comes with these kind of movies but I was pleasantly surprised to find otherwise This was quite the motley crew of riders and they're actually pretty normal They did a good job explaining the route who it was for and some basic planning considerations Mr Noren's filming was great and it had a catchy little soundtrack to go with it This was well worth the cost to rentThanks for this great film!
8.99  These Swedish TV shows follow the books and are pretty good  You meet and get to like Irene's family and part of the story is about them  What is not OK is how they cost $/episode  Not sure that they are worth this much  Is there some copyright problem?  Not sure I want to indulge myseld and watch anymore of this series for $/episode
8.99  She missed the second season when it was on and it is not Netflx  The price is a little high for one show
8.98  Since our little guy is just starting to watch a few Disney movies I decided to buy this online and watch via streaming I meant to purchase the Cars one but with a very active and LOUD little one I wasn't paying attention and purchased this one Maybe better for a child a little older Ours is just  & half It's a shorter movie doesn't last long so for the price I wasn't happy
8.98  My daughter loves loves Mater and this was the best find for me and her  It was cheap and great for traveling if your in need of alittle Mater lol
8.98  The price on this should be much loweryou are getting only  minutes of view timeThe shows are cute - Mater tells an outrageous story and right at the peak of the moment he introduces Lightning McQueen into it and concludes with Mater as the 'hero' and McQueen grateful to be alive!  And as usual with Pixar they have some humor for the adults (I personally love Tokyo Mater - the police car winds up in a donut shop and remarks "I LOVE donuts" proceeding to drive donuts instead of chasing Mater)BUT my boys LOVE Mater and really enjoy the showsand I appreciate that I can get dinner done since this keeps them occupied for half an hour!
8.98  Love the Cars Toons shorts but still think they should be closer to $ It would be nice if they would just sell the shorts for one price and as they make new ones you get them too We bought the initial DVD/BluRay combo but more have come out in singles and we have to purchase them on Amazon to see them :-(
8.98  This was wicked short - too short - and was not worth the price for instant video I ended up just buying Mater's Short Tales for my son to watch
8.98  This is a really cute idea if your kid is into Mater (as mine very much is!) It's only a few minutes long so the price is pretty high but if you can get past that it is funny and the story is well done
8.98  This was a great short My son loved it  but it was too short for the money I would like to see this type of short cost noire than  cents
8.98  A bit expensive for what it is but worth a happy toddler especially on a long car trip  But it's only like  minutes
8.98  My grandson loved MaterGood quality short from DisneyCould have been a lower price for the amount of time Because he wanted to watch over% over
8.98  Made me a fan of Kai Greene The return of Mike Katz was worth the price by itself
10.45  Quality and price were exactly what I was looking for The product also shipped just as was communicated when I ordered it
10.45  Great series and it didn't appear online to watch for free so to be able to get the episodes at a low cost was wonderful
10.45  I liked that Amazon had this episode available with alright price and no strings attached to watch it Thank you
10.45  I am totally hooked  Great series I was skeptical to watch thinking it was some cheap spin off from the Twilight movies but no it's greatA MUST WATCH!
10.45  Ordered this for my daughter and she loves it!!Also the price was excellentI would recommend this to a friendThanks!Thanks!You!
10.45  the chapters i've seen online are amazing I love all the seasons i love the show i love the books and i love Nina Ian And paul All the actors are great and their voices and acting amazing Although i'm a native spanish speaker i love the series in oiginal version english because i love their voices I even met once ian nina and paul and i love them I would like to see them again I would buy all the seasons if it wasn't for the price that's why i see the episodes online because it's expensive but i would love to have all the seasons in dvd although i ndon't know if this dvd works in europe where i livei recommend this series for me is the best tv show that i've ever seen It's amazing I'm looking forward everyweek to watch the next eppisode
9.57  Very well done  You hear from experts on both sides of the isle in their beliefs on the effacacy of milk in our diets  In the end it's about your decision to drink milk or not  I grew up with a glass of milk on the kitchen table for breakfast each morning and i'm convinced that I never had a broken bone due to the calcium intake alone  I also attribute my lifelong consumption of milk to never having weight issues and having good muscle and bone development  The consistent bioavailability of protein aminos and calcium cannot be replaced in my opinonbut to each their own  Give me an alternative that is cost effective and I will be all ears
13.5  I will start by saying that I am a big fan of the entire How To Train Your Dragon series  I loved the movie because it taught that understanding and kindness can go much farther than violence in fixing a conflict  The Dragon Riders of Berk continued that tradition of using intellect to fix problems and yes sometimes relying on the dragon's powers  Defenders of Berk is interesting because it takes the story in a new arch dealing with human enemies who don't want to come to a resolution  Whereas the Dragons were largely innocent in the conflict with the vikings other vikings are not so innocent  This basically works since Dragons are a symbol of nature and the series is really about working with nature instead of trying to conquer it  But it is delivering basically good messages about conflicts even with other humansMy ONLY complaint about this series is that there is not more story line for Astrid  Astrid is a great character and deserves more air time and plot  She isn't just Hiccup's girl friend she is also a dynamic young woman  Perhaps part of my interest in this is that I have twin six year old daughters who love the show and want to see more of Astrid  It would be daring for Disney to develop Astrid more and/or even give her a show  The series is already the number  show for &#;boys&#;  A show about Astrid that didn't portray her a babbling fool only interest in parties dresses and ultra expensive sweet sixteen parties would be a welcome addition to what is offered to young girls today  It is a direction that would make up for a lot of the Disney &#;princess&#; drivel that is produced  Why not feature a bright strong young woman adventurer as a roll model for young girls?
20.28  Very hazy images; is neither full screen or wide screen  Purchased for my son only because I remember watching this years ago  Would not purchase again - only good thing was the price (cheap)
22.05  My little girl just loves this show and I am fond of it myself This was the only place I was able to find the entire series so that was no good but the price here was very reasonable considering A win win!
29.48  My daughter love team umiZumiThe only problem I have with this is the price $ for episode ? ridiculous
29.48  This series is easy to follow and provides an entertaining educational experience for my son The songs are catchy enough for me to enjoy over-and-over-and-over again and my son is LEARNING Relative sizing counting by multiples good sportsmanship teamwork and social skills are just some of the lessons I think the $ price per episode is a bit too high But frankly there is value so I buy one or two when I have a few extra dollars and he loves the variety I've loaded Amazon player on his iPhone and voila    I get my TV back from time to timeLove the series Keep up the good work Team Umizoomi
29.48  My kids love Team Umizoomi and I purchased this episode to buy me some free time  The quality of the picture and the ease of use is great  Now I can pull this episode up anytime my kids want to watch it  I like the option of purchasing single episodes versus the whole season  Very cost effective and convenient
29.49  Although this is short the cartoon is fun and snappy  The humor is clever and both children and adults will find something that will tickle their funny bone  All the original voice actors return which lets you know that this isn't just a cheap cash grab like Disney often does with their sequels that are straight to video disc  My daughters have watched this over and over again because they love the quick story and characters  It is definitely worth the small price of admission to own the video
4.99  My grandson loves the Bubble Guppies He walks around singing the song He is  years old Love the price as well
13.83  I would recommend this to anyone who has children or grandchildren who are into fairies My granddaughter and I have all of the Winx Club (including the Specials and Movie) We enjoy having a sleepover night and watching some of them (over and over again) Better than going to the movies We can get comfortable in our jammies get our snacks (pause if necessary) and it cost alot less than the theater  I think you'd really enjoy these; but you should really start from the beginning in order to understand all of it
13.86  Great movie could hardly tell it only cost k to make
16.99  This was a good pickup because of how cheap it was but it seems as though Jeff get's slighted on both discs Matt's disc was much longer and had a lot on it about how he was always proving he was better It's odd but the content is still really good It'd be a pretty good pickup for anyone that is a fan of either of them
16.98  Great show wonderful family  I love that the episodes are sold at a reasonable price shortly after they air  I enjoy each one
16.98  Totally worth the $Better than paying for cable and its less than the price of a king size candy bar
16.98  I love love love this show but am beyond disappointed that it seems that even after buying the whole season they are not going to release the season finale  TLC - that is cheap and a huge disservice to all of the loyal &#; Kids&#; viewers
16.98  I watched the first show in season  which was the full  minute show  I didn't notice that the nd and rd shows were only  minutes long and were each only / of an episode yet each one cost the same as the first show  This is not mentioned and I think deceiving
16.98  Seriously almost every episode they feel the need to use that line  It was cliche  years ago when Lucas first used it even though he managed to get away with it and make it work  GUYS it's not funny or original!  JeezThat aside this show can't seem to figure out who its audience is  At times the writing seems geared toward little kids but the amount of violence is really more appropriate for teens to adults  Being a Lucas creation it also has that "cute factor" he's become so fond of thrown in occasionally which I can't stand  Fortunately that didn't rear its head so much that I wanted to stop watchingI found this show mildly entertaining  I was on a Star Wars kick at the time so for me it kept my attention simply because it allowed me to hang out in the Star Wars universe for a while  I think it's a "nice" show not particularly clever or creative but nice  The original Clone Wars animated series from  was so much better--THAT had feeling intelligence and creativity behind it  In fact I think it captured much of what Lucas was trying to do in episodes one and two and improved upon it  Anyway if you're at all like me this  version is good if you need a Star Wars fix and can manage not to think too much about it (which I obviously have done ha)However I think I would've been better off buying an audio book  Would've been the same price as season one and I'd have had more content and something meatier to feed my Star Wars hungerAs for the CGI which a lot of people talked about:  a TV showyeah it's pretty good for the time but there was never a point where I was like "Wow this is cool"
16.98  I wish there were more shows like this then maybe we would actually watch some TV! Wish it was a little less expensive to purchase on amazon
16.93  I've seen most of Globeriders videos now and even purchased a few on DVD because they're so well doneWhen I watched the first GR video some time ago I felt a little as though it was a &#;long-format commercial&#; for GR and for BMW However after watching the shows a few times over I realized that they were more about a group of like-minded travelers experiences with other peoples and culturesHelge does very well at pointing out nuances of long distance motorcycle travel and Sterling Noren the videographer captures the spirit of the journeys very wellI recommend Indochina Expedition heartily regardless of how you feel about BMW motorcycles or the price tags of these tours I dualsport ride and adventure ride and these films sure help get me through the wet and soggies of Washington winters with an ear to ear smile on my face! Be sure to look into the Silk Road Tour by GR Only available on DVD (that I know of) due to Amazon Instant Video only being able to stream st episode of  The DVD is worth every penny!
124.95  This is a really good barre-style toning workout  I have gone to some of the barre studio classes and this video is just as tough but much more cost effective!  I do a lot of high impact workouts so I love that I have this as an alternative on days when I want to work out but want to do something low impact  I always feel it in my glutes and outer thighs  It's an hour and  minutes but the time seems to fly by and you get a total body workout  My only complaint is that I don't really like the music but I am able to tune it out and focus on the burn in my muscles!
16.97   was to be my sixth burn but a bone fracture kept me from the playa  So I had to settle with watching the BM webcam listening to the BM radio station (BMIR) watching a lot of Youtube and renting this movie  I wish I could say that I loved Spark but I just didn't connect  It does have a great sound track and much of the videography of on-playa action accompanied by said music is first rate  Seeing BM light up at night watching amazing art cars roam the playa and seeing giant structures burn to the ground does give a sense of the wonder and excitement of this event  Unfortunately these segments are in the minority  The first hour is mostly short interviews with various participants and co-founders (it seems like everyone is a co-founder) interspersed with short videos of them preparing and building and such  Many clips from BM organizational and volunteer meetings are shown  While it is nice to get a "behind the scenes" look at the making of this event I didn't find most of these segments particularly interesting insightful or entertaining  An example is the clip of a woman complaining that BM is slow at getting her a crane to install her artwork and she doesn't know if she'll be charged  I found the last  minutes to be much more engaging as they focused more on the event itself Also $ is among the most expensive Amazon Instant Video rentals I've seen (UPDATE: they've reduced the price to $)
4.78  I have been comparing shows with price and this is a fair price for all the episodes My daughter loves the backyardigans so this is a good way to entertain her while we are traveling
18.19  made a great christmas present bought a different season at a local store first that was way more expensive a good buy
18.19  A really fun and inspiring family/ show to watch for a really great price! Clean humor for the whole family!
18.19  If you have never seen this show  this is a great sample of the show Phil is funnier then I have ever seen him and Uncle Si is getting crazier The photo shoot alone is worth the price of the show
18.19  I loved it! I was able to get this newer version of this at a cheaper price and in a timely manner! Will purchase more Duck Dynasty stuff on Amazon again!
18.19  We changed our tv programming and it is so nice to have options for them that aren't cost prohibitive! Thanks
18.19  Love this series  Season three has deleted scenes and extras  Well worth the price!  Definitely recommend buying season three especially if you are a DD fan!
24.96  The simple well-informed interviews of Y are a great way to spend a lazy afternoon This session with Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich it's a stunning distillation of everything good about a cooking showWe get  minutes with these characters suddenly free of the editing and time constraint of a cooking show All the passion color and personality are there but for once neither Mario nor the interviewer Francine Segan make any attempt to go over-the-top or play to the cameras Instead they just talk tell the most obvious stories and we get a sense of the excellence of these two characters stars instead of  though since the volume is incredibly quiet Also note he swears twice and it's not bleepedThe catch with documentaries cooking shows and public television is that they can be a little expensive to buy on DVDif the episodes are for sale at all So it's a great relief to see Y included on Amazon Prime streaming
14.02  If you decided to rediscover Julia Child after seeing "Julie and Julia" you're in for a surprise  Compared to the frothy angel food cake Meryl Streep portrayed the real Julia Child is more of a date nut bread;  still delicious but much more dense  The black and white of the early shows isn't much of a help either---is that meat really browned?  What can you do?  I preferred the later color shows but even taking into consideration the era the shows were addressing and the audience---women who'd grown up with Science For The Home and packaged food products over real food;  convenience standing in as efficiency I still didn't find the shows all that entertaining and only mildly usefulTo be sure you learn stuff if you haven't been to cook school and I haven't  The French preparation of a chicken is an elegant alternative to the more prosaic American style;  but should we baste it (salting at the end--as Julia tells us doing it earlier will draw out moisture) or salt it a couple of days before and roast it dry--like Zuni Cafe?  That's one problem we don't just have a different way of doing things often there's science behind why we do it that way  Another problem is that food was more expensive forty years ago (which doesn't come across when she announces that a two and a half pound chicken is ninety eight cents but the dollar has lost % of its value since then too) so she often suggests less expensive alternatives some of which fall flat to modern ears  Parsley for Water Cress?  They don't look taste or feel anything alike!  And of course convenience often trumps authenticity as when pie crust is used instead of puff pastry  Yes the audience is being weaned off cooking from packaged food products and trying to learn that Cooking Is Fun(!) so expecting them to rush out to knead butter into flour and roll it out and fold it up four times is a bit much to expect but stillI would recommend these shows for their historic value as they do give an insight into a different America;  when Public Television was as serious and as dry as a BBC miniseries with education trumping entertainment (and Julia Child was very entertaining for her day taking the foibles of cooking as they came urging her audience to relax and go with the flow don't fret the mistakes the dropped food the stuff that breaks when you flip it)  If you live in a big city or close to one and eat out at good restaurants of course you'll notice the difference in what people ate forty years ago and Julia Child was trying as hard to elevate that consumption as Alice Waters would twenty years laterJust be forewarned:  Julia Child is not Meryl Streep she's a sturdy Pasadena girl and all that implies and is best taken on her own terms
14.02  In this episode Julia cooks hamburgers and steaks Her hamburger recipe has of course a French twist: the inclusion of shallot seasonings and beef marrow in the meat and is served under sauce Bordelaise which is a deliciously rich and beefy sauce made with red wine and beef marrow The combination works perfectly and is a favorite hamburger recipe in my house Julia recommends the neck chuck & plate cuts of beef for hamburger with about -% fat which produces juicy burgers that are never dry She debunks the "sirloin" myth; "sirloin" used for ground beef is just the tips leftover after cutting sirloin steaks and isn't anything but a stewing cut anyway As she says in this video "there's no sense in paying  for hamburger the way a lot of people do just because it has a fancy name" Of course the idea that  a pound was once considered expensive for beef is an interesting and sad artifact of how much prices have changed since this show was taped Later during the steak cooking section of this episode Child reviews various suitable cuts of beef along with their prices which will also make you weep for economies past ($ cents for a -pound prime porterhouse steak)During the beef anatomy lesson there's a hilarious moment when the telephone that's hanging on the wall of the kitchen "set" behind the beef chart rings Julia ever the professional pauses and (off-camera) pulls the receiver off the hook and throws it onto the counter then continues on without a word about the incident I can only imagine the confused person on the other end after hearing a hearty 'thump' listening to a slightly distant dispensation about beef carcasses before hanging up in bewildermentThe episode ends with Child's preparation of Tournedos Henri IV expensive bits of saut&eacute;ed filet steak topped with artichoke bottoms filled with Sauce b&eacute;arnaise If you're interested in learning how to prepare the artichoke bottoms check out the episode in season  of "The French Chef" called "Artichokes From Top To Bottom""Steaks And Hamburgers" is an informative episode of the classic series featuring two great (and simple) recipes
14.02  No worrying about production values So she makes a mistake and adds vermouth instead of oil Just makes it better Now the cooking channels seem to care less about the food Rachel Ray is worthy of scraping Julia's pots Notice that Julia doesn't use fancy pots or stoves Would a top chef today use an electric cook top? Of course Julia while selling cookbooks didn't worry about hawking a line of fancy pans She didn't worry about so called healthy food Throw in the butter Health was deemed to taste good I got a kick out of the show where she showed how to make pate She complains that a can of truffles cost $ Today that same can is about $ Dinner at Julia's house would have been one of lifes greatest experiences
14.02  I was very happy to discover that my Prime membership allowed me to view The French Chef with Julia Child episodes in their original broadcast format Julia Child is an amazing cook and each episode is presented in her inimitable style with her eccentricities and friendly down-to-earth mannerI was watching the earlier episodes (in black and white) and marveled at the image and sound quality (not grainy or muffled as I would have expected given the age of the show) Each cooking segment runs about  minutes on average and Julia provides a running commentary throughout which is not only informative (I found myself taking down notes as she spoke) but also a wealth of interesting information and an education in itself For example in the episode "Steaks and Hamburgers" Julia educates viewers on the different cuts of beef complete with diagram and even talks about the cost of the various cuts at that time (a dollar plus for a prime cut good times indeed!)Part of what is so beguiling about The French Chef is the use of language Julia talks about "a prime carcass" referring to the beef cuts and as she instructs viewers on making chocolate mousse she refers to "all the pieces of chocolate and butter intimately blended"! I could not help but chuckle as I listened to her commentary - this lady has style wit and much knowledge! I look forward to learning as much as I can about the fine art of French cooking from these shows!
9.84  Purchased for my wifeshe is in cooking heavendelivered as promised and price was worth the POINTS I got for ordering them for her!
5.14  Love watching these shorts but hate that they charge so much The short is half the price of a full movie They should sell them for about a dollar But I really enjoyed this one
5.14  With this being Black & White it did not hold my son's interest as much as other cartoons This was also WAY too short for the cost of the instant video
5.14  My son loves all the Mater shorts and they're a nice change of pace from the Cars movie My only complaint is that it's too short for the money It's only about  minutes long but cost me $
5.14  I bought this for $ as a quick impulse when my son was watching vids on one of my screens  Turns out this short is already contained in the Mater's Tall Tales video that we bought  months ago  That one is  minutes long  The price (then at least)?  $!  Don't waste your money here
33.99  This is the worst packaging of a beloved franchise  No more cool books inserted like seasons  and   The blue ray version price was too expensive I saw very little difference in my enjoyment of season  in dvd format It was great and much less expensiveThe dvd case is a laughable piece of rubbish
33.99  I love the Clone Wars series and the final season was great  The price was right and I received the item as promised My only beef is disk  of the Blu-ray set has some sound sync issues  The characters speaking on screen don't match the sound coming across  Its not old Kung Fu movie kind of bad but it is noticeable and detracts from the experience  My research showed this was a production issue and I'll need to get a hold of the manufacturer to resolve it  However I see enough other people have experienced this I wish there would have been some kind of heads up  Its not really Amazon's problem but if defective products are out there customers should be warned  Overall this won't keep me from ordering something in the future
33.99  i have all  yrs of star wars on blue ray and as usual item in new/excellent condition ordering was easy good price and arrived before est del date
33.99  My kids and I were all excited upon receiving the order but it soon turned into a huge disappointment when the disc failed to load Not being able to get a replacement from Amazon as well as having now to purchase it from other sellers at a vastly higher cost than the pre-order pricing just rubs more salt to the wound Amazon you can and should do better
33.99  i love star wars clone wars i hat the price for episodes we are in hard economical times but yet some how digital downloads has continued to rise in price to the point of becoming the same as if you drove your car and purchased it how sick is that! you dont have a case for it you dont have previews of up and coming shows on it and yet we have to pay all this bread for it something has got to give
33.99  Great sale price promotion  Loved the series  I felt the last series of episodes in the season were some of the best of the whole series  Great picture and sound  Better experience than watching them live on Cartoon Network when they were initially aired
33.99  Well i Find it Terrible that You want to get this Show on Blue Ray and Then you take it home and it does not work and you have to get the DVD Copy of itSo watch out NOT all blue Rays Play on a blue Ray playerWhy because i got it today and then it just said play and did nothing at allTypical and No way it is BD LIVE and all that other junk So watch out and look at my other reviewsSO  star for Blue ray copyDid not get it from Amazon but if i did then i would ask for a dvd copy of itWEll I have been waiting a long time for this to come out onto either blue Ray or Dvd It is not like i can watch the Tv Stations because depending on what system you have it is hard to watch the showThis Show from Season  was great and it continues to rock and tells more and more each season I am amazed about the story lines and how much they tell then the movies you getIf you are a huge Star wars Fan i would say to get this Season because if you have the Seasons - then you will need to get this showI am not a big fan of box sets unless they have good stuff in it and you do not have the Seasons alreadyAt the time of Season one i did not have Blue Ray and i think that now having a blue Ray Player is good  So for all those who have Blue Ray get this showIf you Have already seen the movies  then get these show because yes they go quickly if you watch them back to back but you get so much out of it that you want moreNow if you do not know they it is already in the works to Make the movies   Now i am not sure what other story lines they will tell but will wait to see what the movie number  tells us after number  moviegood luck in getting this showAbout the price wow find it lower or on sale if you can who knows if they will make Season 
15.47  A lot of the complaints about this series revolve around Fox cancelling the show so rapidly At the time I agreed But since then the networks have tried to listen and found that the audiences still didn't come At least two excellent shows  subsequent to Drive had early numbers problems -- Dollhouse and Journeyman Both got extensions well beyond what their numbers justified and both plateaued at a far lower level than can be justified for a network show It is unfortunate but the network's techniques for gauging what will draw an audience are fairly effective I was a "show editor" for Dollhouse for a TV site when Dollhouse was on I asked in its forums why people weren't watching The answer I generally got was essentially that the people couldn't pigeonhole the show in the first episode So the people you need to complain about regarding the preponderance of unoriginal shows are the audiences not the networks Too many of them want the same old same old and won't wait for something to become clear to themOn Topic: As others have commented the show was a brilliant idea that should have gotten more appreciation The best description is that it was a dramatic version of The Amazing Race The participants all received something that spurred them to come to a central location where they were given a new destination and various rules about how they could "play" They were able to refuse but if they did something bad would happen in regards to the impetus provided -- a kidnapped wife would die a child would never be seen again a cancer treatment withheld or an expensive cure provided -- something that gave them a reason to risk it all to stay in the running Some were in it for a promised material reward as well -- the winner of the race was promised substantial wealth So there was a wide array of subplot elements for each person/group in the race from their own personal private problems to their concern for loved ones and othersOnly three episodes ever got to air on two nights -- The first night Fox premiered the show with a double episode Then the third ep was shown a week later and then it got cancelled One wishes that Fox had given it just a bit longer as I personally think word of mouth would have built on the show but  that's the past and Fox may well have been right
92.07  I went the my local therater in NE Minneapolis to watch this moive  wow  what a great film about the history of american drug war  the movie could have gone on for hours and hours and it would not have covered all the topics of the druge warAfter watching this movie you will probably be pissed off at congress for the horrible laws they have passed  I was acutally a little depressed after and durring the movie  Some the laws that we have passed in America have down way more harm than goodThis movie should be a must see for anyting that wonders about the true effects that the war on drugs has cost nation
92.07  I bought this movie because it was the same price as renting I really enjoyed watching it there were no glitches and good quality picture If you want to learn more about how the war on drugs has done more harm than good you should watch this movie Covers a lot including the history and how it impacts us today
92.07  I ordered this one by mistake and couldn't find out how to return or delete it I started  to watch it but I found out that I really really didn't like it It was written as anti drug propaganda which is fine by me as I don't use drugs but It was dull reading I will chalk the price up as a donation to the war on drugs I didn't finish it as I expect most readers will do the same
18.84  I love videos about Thailand I wish there were more I would appreciate a cheaper price and more choices I think a fair price to watch a  minute video one time should be  cents I mean there is not transport costs no packaging no physical local store Plus that would make Amazon more competitive with other companies that have on-line content
10.97  My  year old likes Super Why with its bright colors and earworm tunes but I personally rank Super Why on the lower end of educational PBS shows For literacy specifically I recommend Sesame Street Between the Lions or WordGirl which have higher quality writing and production values making them MUCH more tolerable -- or even enjoyable! -- to adultsSuper Why probably reuses % of its animation from episode to episode and the entire framework of the show makes little sense Why do they turn into superheroes? Pig's "Alphabet Power" is pretty much exactly the same thing as Princess Pea's "Spelling Power" and speaking of the Princess how is her non-super form any different from her super form? Both have magic wands and similar princess outfitsI also don't like how they CHANGE classic stories and nursery rhymes And why do they need to go into the books to begin with if they're CHANGING the story? Let's just change the Big Bad Wolf in the book into the Small Nice Wolf and that teaches Pig that in the "real world" he should ask Jill to be his friend and stop knocking over his blocks?Argh This show just gets on my nervesIt's certainly not the worst thing out there but compared to Between the Lions or Sesame Street Super Why is rather cheap and mind-numbing
10.97  This show is very funny without going over kids' heads for cheap laughs  I love watching Fig Maple and Hedge help each other learn and be creative!  The animation does a good job of enhancing the humor and creating a safe and interesting milieu for the characters to explore
10.99  good quality defenition with  different episodes the price is less the  bucks  is just awesome  my son enjoy the videos almost every day
10.99  great for kids the songs are catchy and not terrible having to listen over and over again  I got some of the music CD's also for the car  small price for the entertainment value
10.99  I thought I was ordering a book and it turned out to be a DVD It is a bit pricey for a DVD that has no actual Beatle presence which is why I gave it  stars The content reveals a few interesting tidbits however she doesn't reveal any really noteworthy news I enjoyed the better part of the DVD as there were pictures of the Beatles and descriptions of some of the things she did for them At the end however it seemed she was just doing this DVD for the money for her retirement years I would purchase the DVD again as I did enjoy it but I would look to see if I could find it at a less expensive price or perhaps just rent it from a rental service if possible
10.99  First an important caution when reading reviews of this product Amazon has a policy of grouping all reviews of all formats of a film (theater Amazon Instant  DVD BD) together As I submit this review there are already  reviews posted only one of which is of the DVD or Bluray So I always suggest to look to see which product is being reviewed and to look for the date of the review That will guide you best Now on to my review of the BlurayOf  the thousands of reviews I&#;ve written for Amazon I&#;ve rarely &#; if ever &#; felt that there was another review of a product that covered practically everything one could say about it But after reading David Kusumoto&#;s review of the Bluray/DVD release of this film I have to send you there for a thorough and well-written review I&#;ll try to add a few more facts and my take on the film and the package&#;Good Ol&#; Freda&#; started making the film festival circuit in early  and played at the WXPN Music Film Festival in Philadelphia in April  I missed that one shot chance to catch it but heard great things from friends and was anxious for the home video release Magnolia films has been making a name for itself in releasing music related documentaries (&#;Muscle Shoals&#; was also at the April WXPN festival &#; and I did catch it and it&#;s great &#; and Magnolia will be releasing it in January (hopefully with lots of bonuses) But back to FredaAs David pointed out in his review there is a wonderful commentary track that reveals more stories than are shone in the film But remember that Freda was a loyal dedicated secretary for  years (one year LONGER than the Beatles were together as a band) and no real secrets are revealed But when she discusses the parents of the &#;boys&#; &#; especially weekly teas with Ringo&#;s mom (she only refers to Ringo as &#;Ringo&#; in the Q&A; at at Beatlefest  - included as a bonus; in the film he is always called &#;Richie&#; and Brian Epstein is called &#;Eppie&#;  - you get a deeper feeling for the family life of the Fab FourIn one of the bonus interviews with the Director of the film we learn that he shot  hours of film and says that he hopes that much of it would be on the DVD release But there are only five scenes totaling just  minutes (I&#;m not complaining &#; just commenting)As noted by others &#; four Beatles songs are included in the soundtrack along with a bunch of classic songs that the Beatles covered (by Arthurs Alexander The Chiffons Marvelettes) including the most expensive to license: Ketty Lester&#;s &#;Love Letters&#; Oddly enough the Lester recording was not remastered and has lots of &#;crackle&#; Surely they could have found a better copy to use (again a comment not a complaintSo in summary all Beatles fans will want this Bluray even if you have seen the film at a festival And even if you are a casual music listener who grew up with their music you&#;ll find the -minute film and its bonuses worth watchingI hope you found this review both informative and helpfulSteve Ramm&#;Anything Phonographic&#;
10.99  Don't be fooled - this is NOT the new Teen Titans Not that there was anything wrong with that show mind but this program is decidedly not geared solely toward the younger generation This is true despite the fact that it revolves around teenaged superheroes For one thing the adult Justice League is never far away from the action Batman makes frequent appearances Black Canary is the team's trainer Captain Marvel is practically a member and there's a slew of cameos by virtually every other prominent hero in the DC universe (and quite a few of the lesser-known ones) So if you were disappointed that "Justice League Unlimited" was being replaced by a show with a younger cast of characters don't beUnlike many other shows featuring teenaged characters Young Justice actually makes good on its promise to show growth and character development in its cast We see these kids struggling with realistic believable issues as they seek to become worthy of the Justice League Yes there is some romance but it's handled in a refreshingly subtle fashion The humor is almost always spot-on And aside from the characters the plot is incredible There's a strong emphasis on an overall story arc in which the stakes get higher every week - especially as we learn that nearly all our beloved young heroes have big secrets There's an air of darkness to Young Justice though I wouldn't say it ever quite gets oppressive enough to cost the show its family-friendly label The drama is quickly building towards a climax that will shake the whole universe in which the show is based So I recommend you start catching up now - you won't be sorry
10.99  Enjoyed thoroughly and will definitely use this service again and highly recommend this service Will definitely use again Very cost efficient!
12.99  I watched this show on hulu and I have to say it's one of the most brilliant shows I've ever seen  I'm a bit saddened that intelligent programming can't survive while bad programming can but I realize TV is a business and reality shows cost a lot less to make than a show like this
12.99  I'm not sure where the previous reviewer located her information but Michael Green stated that Kings was NOT created to be only a mini-series  The exact wording from a much longer good-bye post on The Court Historian website was:"Kings was originally picked up for  hours of content  episodes with the two-hour pilot It was not a mini-series but a full series with a full series' ambitions to last for much longer"Michael GreenCreator KingsSunday July  []I do agree that the price for this DVD set seems rather steep to me and I hope Amazon does lower the cost at some point as it often does with TV DVDs  The series was terrific for many of the reasons already stated by others so I won't repeat them again  It is indeed disappointing that the curtain has come down on the vibrant and exciting Kingdom of Gilboa
12.99  Let's face it "Kings" was too smart too literary and too good to succeed on network TV Much like HBO's "Rome" "Kings" was exciting epic and way too expensive to succeed as anything other than an American-Idol-level ratings phenomenon Since no scripted show on TV without "CSI" in its name can even come close to those numbers today it was doomed to fail from the start After all why should a network spend millions of dollars PER EPISODE on a quality scripted drama that hardly anyone watches when they can spend pennies on reality programming that lures in tens of millions of viewers each week?The creators deserve much credit for conceiving an immersive fully-realized world and finding vital energy in a rarely-told Old Testament story The cast is excellent -- and can be forgiven for occasionally using the stylized dialogue as an excuse to chew scenery The cinematography production design and use of real NY locations are also well-executed in every episode starting with Francis Lawrence's ("I Am Legend") thoroughly engaging -hour pilot"Kings" had a hell of a reign however brief We few loyal fans can only hope that the Series DVDs sell enough copies to allow the creators to produce a made-for-TV or direct-to-DVD film that brings this story to the worthy ending we all want to see
12.99  i agree the with the last fellow the price is lil steep for such a short season but it is totally worth it! i loved this show when it aired on tv so i wanted copy of the show to own just finished watching it and now im hooked again and little angry this amazing show was cut the plot is deep the characters believable one of the best tv shows i think you can watch just started making my friends watch last few episodes with me and now they want to borrow and watch the rest
12.99  I watched every moment of this show  I love it  I have watched my DVD collection almost in entirety (the Disc  is terribly scratched and does not play all episodes)I received this as a gift for my birthday I had asked for it on my wishlistI am so disgusted with NBC for the way they treated this show  Maybe if they had given it a chance it would have been a hit for years to come  However I think personally that the religious nature of this show is what killed it  I think NBC deemed it not a failure because of the great writingnor even the ratings I think it was too controversial for NBC to handleIt was a shame that no cable company picked this show upbut then it would have been expensive to keep using the gorgeous NYC settingsI truly hope that someday there is an end to this seriesand a middle  Whether someone writes about it in a bookfilms a movie about itor makes a great mini-series I will be thereMy husband encourages me to pick up the tale where it left off but I am not a writer Maybe if I was youngerAnywaybuy this DVD for your collection and the only thing you will be upset about is the fact that NBC did away with its best series ever
12.99  I had found a t v website that had all of the episodes but before I could put them on disk my computer died so since Amazon had them at a good price I went ahead and ordered from them I could not be sure the sites would keep them on-line for a long time I had mentioned the show to a friend of mine who had not heard of it so he watched it on line and loved it We both agreed that the show should have lasted for more than one season
12.99  One of the best shows NBC has come out with in my (short  years) life time Kings is a phenominal show depicting the intriuge of polotics in a fictional modern woeld in many ways smilar to our own though crittically acclaimed the series fail to draw in a large enough crowd to justify its + million dollar price tag for just  episodes By watching the show from the beginning to the end the viewer will have a chance to fully understantd the intricate twists the plot takes while falling in love with the characters that all undergo drastic change in a mere dozen hours the fact is this is one of the best shows that ever went on the air and that it failled to get its rightfull recognition in its time will only brighen it star in times to come when history shall be its judgeI would recomend this show to nyone i know because it draws the viewer in enchanting them with both the scale of the stories world as well as the depth its characters This is the kind of show that will draw you in and force you to watch it from beginning to end in one sitting***** Five stars no question
12.99  I really do not blame the person who rated this with one star because the show was never made to go past the first season  Mr Green even stated that on the King's website  I think that was so unfair to the people who fought hard to keep the show  To find out after the show finished that there was never an intention to go further was very disappointingHowever I really enjoyed Kings  I pre-ordered the DVD in April  I've been waiting a long time  I'm glad I ordered that early because of the price changes  The show is worth watching I'm hoping it has interviews from the cast because the price of it now is awfully high to pay for just the basic episodes  To me asking that much for this wonderful show is taking advantage of the loyal followers  The arrogance is downright unforgivingThere were a lot of followers who fought really hard to get Kings on another station  It really was infuriating to learn that it was only intended for one season and the shooting site was torn down and everyone went their separate way  Although we knew it had ratings problems it was never said it didn't have a chance elsewhere  We were hoping someone else would pick it up but Mr Green let everyone know that everything was done and over withAs good as Kings was I do hope they bring the price way down before the release date  I locked my price in early; however I can't see a lot of people even loyal followers paying that much
12.99  If I were to say that i LOVE this series it would be a massive understatement! This is one of the BEST TV shows ever! For this price you cannot say no! I followed this show from day one and I own the set it is absolutly the GREATEST and will not dissapoint!
12.99  $ dollars for this DVD set is just TOO high!!!  I own the "Book Of Daniel" (which I like slightly better than "Kings") and I got THAT set from Amazon for $  BOD has  fewer eps than this DVD set so I think a fair price might be $-$ Has Amazon or the video company who manufactured "Kings" heard that we are in a recession now?  You'd THINK that they'd want to move some productI'll buy this but I'll have to wait until the price AmazonCom is asking drops below $ (or maybe I'll go over to eBay to see what I can find)
12.99  This show does have its faults The biggest one is how modern speech is intermingled with Shakespearean dialogue it gives the show gravitas but it cuts back on the realism There are some unlikely events but since this is a retelling of a Bible story in a modern setting I don't mind it and as a sci-fi enthusiast I even like it The show does take things very seriously with two unlikely security guards providing comic relief that quite frankly isn't very funny There is a lot about the world that we don't know and there is little exposition which will drive alternate universe fans up a wall Additionally if you jump into the series mid-stream it may take you a few minutes of viewing to become acclimatedIf you can get past those faults you'll find some of the best there is on TV right now especially network TV Sub plots that seem to have nothing to do with one another cleverly weave together throughout the hour to come to surprising twists at the end Though the characters are mostly archetypes they are very interesting and you want to know more about them-- especially Silas and how he became king The way religion is portrayed and how it affects things is very reminiscent of the new Battlestar Galactica; the multi-ethnic cast reminiscent of Star Trek politics will have you waxing nostalgic for The West Wing and best of all it's not another cop lawyer or doctor show It's not insipid reality TV or a recycled sitcom This is truly original intelligent programmingUnfortunately due to the worst viral marketing campaign I have ever seen I don't think we'll get another season so get this show and watch it on your own NBC did very little to promote this series but is going out of its way to push another cheap cop drama on us The show the story the actors and we the viewers deserve better If we're lucky maybe a cable channel will pick it up and we'll get some more brilliance NBC should not have been given the chance to kill this critically-acclaimed show It deserves to be on HBO-- and in your DVD collection
12.99  From the very first episode it was clear that Kings was doomed There was plot there was actual depth and there was a lot of thought put into this series It's sad that NBC put an end to the series without the natural conclusion that was there but this was their choiceThe DVD is just as good as the series and even at prices more expensive than a full season (this is only the  episodes shown) it delivers Each disc contains deleted scenes special features and goodies for the viewer unlike most from show dvd's anymore that cram it all into one The quality is (of course) excellent and I've already made it through the dvd set twiceIf you didn't get a chance to watch it when it aired find a way to watch just one episode through unbox THEN from there decide whether or not you want to spend Amazon's price for this It is a bit high but if you like QUALITY television you will love this show
11.34  I want to preface my review with the fact that I am a professional dog trainer with over  years experience I have run my own dog training business since  and I do only private in-home instruction such as Victoria Stillwell (and Cesar Millan) do only I have been doing it twice as long as they have So I am well aware of the dynamics of working with families and their dogs and the parameters of a dog trainer's responsibility in doing this workThis series started out in Season One as classy informative interesting and entertaining I liked Victoria's approach to training as it is very much like my own her rapport with her clients reminded me of my own and since we never stop learning I was even able to pick up some helpful tips from watching the show I agree with most of her techniques and philosophy although I think she goes overboard when it comes to her melodramatic aversion to invisible fences which work out well in most cases and have saved many dog's lives There were always some "over-the-top" elements to the show of course even in Season  such as Victoria giving her clients expensive gifts and taking them all over town to venues such as rock-climbing centers! However I understand that this is "show biz" and is not going to mirror an actual dog trainer's world % accuratelySo after viewing Season  on DVD I wanted to see more of the show but thought the price for Season  was kind of high so I decided to skip to Season  on Amazon's Instant Video which was reasonably priced However to put it mildly I was in for a big disappointment with Season ! It's like night and day in comparison to Season  Having not seen Seasons  &  yet I'm not sure exactly when the show began to deteriorate but IMO in Season  the show has really "jumped the shark" Some of the people Victoria is now dealing with in Season  are crass obnoxious and trashy yelling screaming and cursing at each other in a way I find completely off-putting In  years I have very rarely if ever worked with people as objectionable as those shown in Season 's programs!In Season  it seems that "Me or the Dog" decided to lower its standards to the basest common denominator and go along with all the other gross and tasteless reality series that show human nature at its very worst I was born and raised in New York although I have not lived there since  so I especially resent that some of the episodes in Season  make people in NY & NJ look like the crud between the toes of the USA which is just not the case!Besides all of the above my biggest complaint with the sad turn this program has taken is that there is very little actual work with the dogs being shown I also don't like the change in format In early seasons they would show how the clients were carrying on with the practice and then Victoria would go back and help them correct the things they were doing wrong and take the training a little further OK it was silly to have her watching them on her laptop and then rushing off to their house but in reality in most cases I see my clients for multiple sessions and they practice with their dog in-between so having Victoria go back periodically was true-to-lifeWith the new format Victoria does not usually go back after a few weeks; she just leaves and then we are shown what happens two or three weeks later with not much further input from Victoria Way too much of the show now is taken up with human psychodrama We get enough of that on other reality shows Enough already -- as another reviewer pointed out this is ANIMAL PLANET! Hello! We want to see more about the animals not the screwed-up people they have managed to find under some rocks for this season's episodesIMO in Season  Victoria totally oversteps the bounds of a professional dog trainer and is acting more like a psychologist/marriage/family counselor Of course one always TACTFULLY uses psychology in this line of work in dealing with both the humans and animals but for a dog trainer to be giving his/her clients marital advice and lecturing them on their parenting and family dynamics is I feel totally inappropriate In real life if I presumed to be a family counselor and lectured my clients about how they were living their lives I would not be in business very long; plus I think that ethically I would be misrepresenting myself My authority and responsibility extend only as far as how my clients relate to their dog(s) and making them realize that they will only have success if they all work together However the decision to do so is up to them It's my job to bring harmony into their lives by helping them to train their dogs -- PERIOD!Researching Victoria Stillwell's background one sees that she was a professional actress before becoming a dog trainer Maybe these skills go together as I have always been interested in acting myself though I have not done it professionally But it explains why she is able to have her own show about training and also why it has gone way over the top with melodrama  And yes the silly "Kit Kat Break" is entirely transparent as are the other brand-name plugs that pop up here and there when Victoria gives her clients gifts (but that's the way it always is with sponsors)Wish I could give this season a higher rating but in all honesty I just cannot I do not think this deterioration of the show into histrionics is Victoria's own idea; I agree with another reviewer that it is probably pressure from the network to take a classy show and reduce it to tasteless drivel I too miss the old Victoria and the old format Big mistake producers of "It's Me or the Dog!" You should be the ones wearing shock collars!
12.0  My buddy and I thought this would be useful for planning our WABDR trip we want to take Unfortunately it was full of lots of pretty scenery but not much in the way of info related to preparing for a trip like this Not all of us can have chase vehicles and all the most expensive gear so we need to be a bit more prepared and aware of things like good places to camp places to go for mechanical repairs etc Definitely worth a rental but don't expect much in the way of content to be used for planning purposes
12.0  Have caught the series on BBC in the past LOVED IT! Have been shopping for the DVD Can't wait til Amazon sells the season as a whole too expensive for me by the episode
12.9  Season  is a great series even with subtitles If your keen with the genre of Inspector Morse Inspector Lewis Poirot Zen and Wire in the Blood this is for you Great production with slices of life in Sweden the judicial system and terrific plots Henning Mankell's intricacies of plots character development and dramatic construction is these "who done it" episodes is terrific Would highly recommend it  I've found that the subtitles make watching even more intense  Well worth the price of admission although I'd be happier if Amazon gave you a fixed price for the whole season rather than having to buy each episode Even with that every episode is a superb experience
10.1  I use to watch this cartoon when i was a kid then i seen it on amazon it's still awesome and it twenty years old It's like half price per episode if you purchase a whole season not a bad deal at all
10.1  The writing is superb The animation superb The voice acting superb Everything about this series OOZES excellence I could not imagine my childhood to not include many long hours watching the series So glad it's on Amazon Prime streaming WELL worth the price of admission to watch this entire series
10.0  I ordered Stevie Nicks new album as soon as I heard about it  I assumed the low price was a pre-sale promo price so I ordered it expecting the real thing  What I received will not play in any of my CD Players only in the laptop  I am so disappointed that it is not the real thing  I know I should return it but I destroyed all the packing material and return labelsWill never order music again through Amazon
10.2  I am an elementary teacher who &#;bought&#; this for my iPad But when I tried to show it to my first-grade class there was a message on the screen that I was not authorized to show the film Okay I get the need for copyright protection and it would be sleazy to try to show this to a paying audience or whatever--but it isn't available on a DVD (which I would be willing to buy) so there's no way I can show this to children unless they watch it on the iPad screen one or two students at a time I think this does a disservice to the film If the film makers and/or producers are worried about pirate downloads then please issue as a DVD or up the download price a little and allow for the video to be projected on a screen
13.77  John Anthony West (JAW) has elaborated and explained aspects of the work of Schwaller de Lubicz who in The Temple Of Man and other works had brought astounding realism and depth to what 'modern' archaeology has no real understanding of Much of what Egypt was about is intuitive and unmeasurable and escapes the narrow measures of scientists In this DVD/video and this series you get a taste of both Schwaller de Lubicz' work JAWs interpretations and of the original sites themselvesSo of course this is a highly recommended introduction to this work It's just too bad that it's not discounted At $ a DVD across eight parts ($) you are talking some serious change Amazon should make the entire series available for online streaming rental This type of work deserves to be more well knownIf you look around you can find these online for less expensive viewing Just don't bother with the vid of JAW talking to Joe Rogan It does neither of them any credit
16.7  I'm biasedthe show is one of my favourite ones I've ever watched Everything about it is great Stana's greatNathan's greatthe cast is greatthe premise is great This episode was no exception Start to finishloads of fun and heart Now that the fans have CASKETTit will get better and better!!

16.7  Awesome episode not so good on the play from Prime Too bad Maybe a Fire would address this but I may not want the cost and one more device
16.7  Much more convenient than buying the DVDs - less expensive and no storage problems  I'm an Amazon Digital convert! Will buy here from now on Quality is excellent
16.7  I own every season of Castle and have loved them all! I cannot wait for the next season The only complaint I have is the cost of each season I am planning on setting up season  on my DVR
16.7  I am pleased to have found a reasonably priced set of this show that I have just started to watch to allow me to catch up with the series at my own pace A lot of things happened in the fifth season so I really wanted to have this season's shows on DVD so I could catch up with the shows I missed before the current season began I was very pleased  with the reasonable price that I paid for this set of DVD's
16.7  Castle and Beckett believe a murder case is linked to a storage locker Castle bids and wins the storage locker and its contents but only finds cheap trashy treasures When Captain Victoria Gates sees Castle holding a rare porcelain doll that would complete her collection he happily hands it over Suddenly the captain loves Rick and even buys a complete set of his books for him to autograph Working through a list of suspects the murder victim's employer's household and seemingly unrelated low lifes the reason for murder and perpetrator is found Unfortunately resolving the murder costs Castle his new found friendship with the captain and she is back to hating him by the end of the episode Very funny entry in the Castle cannon
16.7  Crime drama is a very successful formula type All you have to do is look at the long-running CSI and Law & Order series and their spin-offs to see just how true it isSome background: This is a very creative variation on the genre Throw in a successful mystery writer (Richard 'Rick' Castle) with a satiric sense of humor a detective (Kate Beckett) who considers him an extreme inconvenience and a mayor who is a great fan of Richard's booksRick needs inspiration for his new series He talks to the mayor and the mayor saddles Beckett with Castle Kate is less than pleased with this arrangement but has no choice and after all it is just for one book One crime one book Right?? Nope The book happens and the mayor loves it and much to her dismay Rick becomes a feature in her homicide investigationsWhen we get to Season  we have a blooming romance that Rick's daughter is in favor of An ex-wife (and Rick's publisher) that wants to make Rick's life more interesting and of course more homicidesI don't want to give any specifics this is a series you have to see Never tuned in? Buy the seasons and catch up It is well worth the bucks you pay And Castle is one of the less expensive Video on Demand TV seasons out there Just $ for the first season Just  episodes Just enough to hook you Wonderful entertainment (Trust me)
16.7  We enjoy the series and it makes it all the better when there are no adds  the price is right for the enjoyment and convenience we get
16.7  I am a Castle  the series collector This is an amazing price for the whole fifth season of Castle Well worth it!
12.01  raw current great characters not exactly from books so more stories than just the original books This series is dated  hope the producers are still going  Story content is up with MI-/Spooks and Trevor Eve's Waking the Dead  Wish it cost less for the season
12.01  It makes absolutely no sense to me that you can get the later versions free and yet these earlier ones cost $ /piece for a rental?  Come on! It should be the opposite!  In any case if you want the REAL Mankell's  Wallander stay away from the PBS tripe and stick with this original gritty series
12.01  I like this series very much as I did the PBS series and the books but I have to object to the cost per episode as too high It doesn't make any sense I almost didn't start watching and I may not continue because of it It's a shame
12.01  Netflix only has season  but these episodes are expensive so I have to ration them Love this series and sad to see there were only  seasons
56.0  This is hands down one of the greatest documentaries I have ever watched It tells the story of Detroit Fire Department and it's incredible struggles Many departments in the country are facing the same struggles to some scale Departments everywhere are facing budget cuts which create an immediate adverse effect on the firefighters themselves Hopefully this documentary will open the eyes of people everywhere Fire protection isn't a luxury it's a necessity that costs money If we as citizens of a community don't commit to providing the funding required it will cost lives
10.95  Discs and DVDs are a thing in the past For $ I can watch this in HD on my Xbox Kindle Chromebook or Computer without worrying about scratching up a disc This is a great production that displays key moments of a magnificent Stanley Cup winning season that I will be able to watch at will on any device I own for years to come The extras are fun I do like the open mic of the first three rounds of the playoffs covering all teams not just the Blackhawks It's only negative is it's censored but that's understandable This is a great buy at a fraction of the cost of a DVD and a must have for any Blackhawks fan
10.95  Great Buy! wish it was a dvd or bluray but i guess this will due for now for the price its great i started watching this on my computer and then i realized that i have the app on the xbox so i jumped on that HD is perfect anyone that is worried about not watching this on your TV that is how i would do it if i was you HAWKS ALL THE WAY!!!!
10.95  I wish I could leave this review without any stars because I'm so pissed about the fact that this is only available on Amazon Instant Video In  I purchased both of the Blackhawks' Championship videos and still watch them but I doubt I'll watch this more than once The fact that this isn't available as a hard copy is ridiculous The NHL should be ashamed that they were so cheap that they thought that this was a good idea That's fine if they wanted to produce an instant video option but they absolutely needed to also produce a hard copy one I can only hope that the Blackhawks will remedy this fact and produce something that follows along on their run through the playoffs on their way to the CupDo better NHL do better!
34.99  I believe in natural remedies so I naturally love thisand anything similar Most herbs are cheap and safe to use so i'm really interested in this
7.04  I was expecting much better quality (ie close to DVD quality) and didn't get it It's probably close to / quality  The DVD is essentially the same price except for shipping Go with the DVD over the instant video
7.04  There was never a price on this So I clicked it then got an email that I was charged for it
7.04  Great price for an entire season Plays awesome on my Kindle Fire Keeps my favorite  month old happy when we are out and about
7.04  We caught this show while visiting my brother and his family for a few days  They had many episodes recorded on their satellite DVRMy wife and I thought it was silly at best and not very educational  Yes each episode has a theme and teaches kids about something but in an off-the-wall way  Unfortunately our  yr old loved itOnce we got back home she wanted to continue watching it - so much so that she forgot about Sesame Street Blue's Clues Busytown Mysteries and The Backyardigans  We cut the cable almost  years ago so she catches all of these shows via Roku boxes with Netflix and Amazon Prime  We love not having the expensive cable bill but still being able to enjoy TV on demand  But back to the review of this product :)We were not happy about her interest in the show but thought she would grow out of it after a few days  Though it was silly it wasn't bad for her (or so we thought) and we would work-in the other showsThere was one particular episode where all of the characters wear different hats - it was her favorite  Soon we noticed she was getting scared in the middle of the day and would come running for protection from er something  It turns out that episode had a part where kids are shooting each other with lasers emitting from their hands  She was afraid they were doing to "get" herI never got into the Teletubbies but from what I did see this show reminds me of it  The characters all have silly voices and are just people running around in costumes with a little tidbit of knowledge for the + year olds  We don't recommend it for kids at all but little ones ( &lt; ) should be steered clear entirely  There are much better shows out there for children that will both entertain and educate them  We do like the music that is interwoven into each episode but it's not enough to keep us tuned in  Skip this one
7.02  My  year old son loves Chuggington Pretty good price for a  minute show Good annimation and good content for a little one
7.02  This has been my  year old's favorite show for the past months He requests watching an episode each day and loves them I enjoy hearing crack up out loud at some of the silly things that happen The episodes are perfectly timed (about - minutes each) and keep his attention the entire time Personally I have enjoyed getting to &#;know&#; all the trains with their good variety of personalities and voices The voice acting is well done and the animation is colorful and lively Different seasons have different prices so check the price per episode to make sure it is worth your money purchasing it DVDs are also available if you only want to pick up a few episodes (saw them at Target and Amazon for like - bucks)
5.59  need coupon codes to watch these shows are to expensive help please  if these shows were free with the prime membership I would consider getting it
16.43  As a graduate of the Naval Academy I was very interested in seeing this movie  It paints a real picture of both Academies and what we all strive for  Any individual that graduates from a service academy knows that they may be sent in harms way  We choose this pat and acknowledge the price that we may have to pay  Not too many football players can make it in the NFL so they play for the joy of the game and the challenges it offers  This movie shows what is really like  I highly recommend it
16.45  We are big fans of Donna Leon and her  Commisario Brunetti Have read almost every one of her books featuring the Brunetti characterThis film does an excellent job of bringing the book to life The actor playing Brunetti creates the character almost exactly as we 'pictured' him in the books And the intricacies of the police politics while not in the depth of her books are nevertheless in the movieAt first we were a little disappointed that the film was in  German vs Italian BUT they all did an extraordinary job making us forget that factOnly disappointment was the cost ($) of the rental Tried to buy the DVDs which are over $ for just two episodes So despite really enjoying this series not sure we will watch any more at those prices
16.49  some of the shows have poor quality of picture  It is nice to have all of them in one spot so I don't have to search youtube for them but the price is not worth purchasing all of them
14.4  I loved this show from the first moment -- it's funny smart interesting; the secondary character Edgar is worth the price of admission I was VERY disappointed to learn it had been canceled after just one season
5.24  This is the same Pixar SHORT film that appeared before the movie Cars  It is the very charming tale leading up to the Toy Story Barbie's and Ken's first kiss My daughter watches it frequently and it always brings a smile to my faceThis is a short film thus that is why the cost is low This film will only last a few minutes It is NOT a full length filmThis film takes place after Toy Story  (TS) and other than the presence of additional characters from TS one doesn't have to worry about this film giving away any of the plot of TS if you (or your child) hasn't seen that full-length movie
7.99  AWESOME dvd about the FWP  I didn't want it to end it was so good!Great price too  I suggest you buy it because you'll want to watch it over & over
7.99  You can't go wrong with Rick Steve's brand of travel dvds and booksHowever I wished that in this program he could have showed more places to hang out  He could have also provided more information on how to get to the sites and method of travel to get to the locations since many of the locations are not in walking distance  And he could have given more travel tips on how much a taxi ride should cost so that you travelers don't get price gouge (a very common problem with tourists) train ticket price point bus ride price point etc And more information on recommended hotels to stay at  And more recommended great eats restaurants cafes etc and price points for the hotels and restaurants  And business hours of the museums historical sites etcAnd although I like the history lessons that he gives on the different places he should squeeze in more of the traveling tips that I have mentioned above  I felt like Rick took too much time in the program to talk about the history of the place and ran out of time to give more travel tips (as stated above)He should organize the program in the traveler's shoes  Meaning he should start off the program with arriving at the airport to how to get a taxi ride (without getting price gouge) get to the hotel plan his route map for the trip with sites and restaurants where he went to first where he ate breakfast lunch dinner etc  What he did on day     ectNo other travel show do this but I hope that someone from Rick Steve's team will read this review and make the next travel program like thisI am travelling to Europe in a few weeks so I watched this to get an idea of what to do and how to get around where to eat sleep etc  and I didn't find his show very helpful for this purpose  It is still entertaining but could have been more helpful with more practical tipsI also own his travelling companion books for the different cities and countries that I will be traveling to  His books have more information but I don't have time to go through hundreds of pages from his books from cover to cover  So I was hoping that watching his program could be a shortcut but it wasn't much helpI recommend getting the &#;Lonely Planet&#; Series of travel books if you are planning to travel because they are more helpful than Rick's books  The Lonely Planet books have more details of eateries places to visit hotels price points maps trip planned  Very similar to Rick's books except Lonely Planet is more straight to the point and is more organized in my opinion  So it makes it easy to get to the information that you need to really quickHope this will help you get prepared for a great trip!
22.5  Being a small scale produce farmer I can relate to this film so much He doesn't even get into the high cost for small farms to get certified making it cost prohibitive to so many While GM corn and soy farmers rake in government subsidies to produce animal feed ethanol and processed foods Our food system has become quite the joke! He barely scratches the surface!
22.5  I enjoyed how this documentary was put together  It included many aspects of the organic industry that I didn't realize existedmany many relationships tie in to the end cost at the grocery store that would surprise many people  From the farmers to the government to the retailers to the customersawesome how this production shows those relationships! It really is &#;food for thought&#;!!
22.5  The sources who are interviewed in this film show the varying perspectives regarding the actual value of the term and classification of food as "organic"  It's great but it seems like the producer missed the mark when he said that regardless of all the evidence of the failure of "organic" to actually provide consumers --us-- with any assurances that organic food is healthier for us he still chooses organic  Maybe he means organic from small farmersFor me its simple eat organic animal products because that means no antibioticsBut in terms of fruits and vegetables just go local and with the independent small farmersIf you can't buy from a farmer directly like at a farmers market and are forced to buy from your huge chain grocery store then you should probably just go with nonorganic The price difference means very little if anything in terms of health benefits
22.5  This movie tells the truth about organic foodsIt goes into about how the farms have to to do different things to be organicThis movie tells why organic foods cost so much The director asked normal people a  lot of questions about food
28.56  Unlike a lot of reality shows this is really fun $ per season each episode is great Honestly it is like watching a good youtube seriesMore entertainment for my money than buying most any other series with the $ price per season
28.56  Absolutely love it and will continue to watch Excellent preparatory ground for any entrepreneur selling any service or product The panelists are impressive in quickly assessing the virtue and growth potential of any proven idea Key word is proven The investors rarely go for any investment unless the business has at least one year of proven operating results and healthy margins Most important: know your numbers Customer acquisition cost customer drop off rate production cost per unit savings in margin if production could be scaled wholesale price retail price competitors and market share I am hooked
5.99  This has been my  year old's favorite show for the past months He requests watching an episode each day and loves them I enjoy hearing crack up out loud at some of the silly things that happen The episodes are perfectly timed (about - minutes each) and keep his attention the entire time Personally I have enjoyed getting to &#;know&#; all the trains with their good variety of personalities and voices The voice acting is well done and the animation is colorful and lively Different seasons have very different prices so check the price per episode to make sure it is worth your money purchasing it DVDs are also available if you only want to pick up a few episodes (saw them at Target for like - bucks)
5.99  While the information within these clips is good they really are just "clips"   not episodes  The "First Season" has  "episodes" that TOGETHER make around  minutes of content  Said another way the first "season" is less than the length of a single episode of a TV show  To give you an example of the pacing of these episodes the nd one from the first season only teaches how to play a one chordApart from being short the reason this content is free is because it advertises a website that teaches guitarThat said if you're just starting out you'll definitely get some good information here Just don't expect it to be a replacement for a more robust training program  I give it  stars because it's more of an advertisement for a website but the content (though paltry) is useful and the price is rightBottom line: You'll learn something if you're just starting out - but you certainly shouldn't pay for something like this
5.99  If all lessons are available in one DVD and the price is okay I will buy it
5.99  ivideosongs and their concept/presentation rules supreme to 'no kidding' all the + instructional CD's DVD's and books I own Signature Licks Hal Leonard's play-along Guitar One etc all are missing elements that ivideo covers each and every time!  What do copy musicians want when buying this product or any of music from the aforementioned sources?  Answer: To sound like the original artist!  I have been to the concerts bought the TAB the CD and I even asked Keith Richards back stage for the fingerings and still there is something missing and that is THE SOUND (Set-up)! How do you get that twang or overdrive that makes my guitar sound just like the record?  Well as far as I know ivideos is the only professional pay source over my past year searching that gives it all!  You get the pro instruction without any 'you tube' Speech  style repeating 'ums' and 'ahs' or 'excuse me I meant this' blunders For  bucks per ivideosong when you do the math you get the ultimate in tools to nail the song ' to-a-tee' at the same cost per capita as a Signature lick book or similar  Stars for iVIDEOSONGSThis 'st Season' ivideo presentation; should have been fully/better explained just like my fellow reviewer stated -  Stars for not doing so Nobody wants clips especially if that is not what you want and paid for; but  do go to ivideosongs website the song selection is sparse right now but later surely this will be my only 'go to' source for my Top- copy bands' chops!
8.78  I would strongly prefer it if this show was not an elimination show The stress of possible elimination causes competition and rivalry not cooperation These people  should be allowed to encourage one another toward healthIf a contestant became verbally abusive of others in the house they should be isolated from the othersIf the contestants were allowed a SAFE environment in which to lose weight where the motivation was a carrot and not a stick (elimination) their body chemistry including cortisol might improve and allow faster loss of body fatThe goal should be loss of body fat NOT of weight Loss of lean muscle is NOT an appropriate goal nor is dehydrationA group is selected That group should be followed through out the season Eliminating players with lower numbers biases the data of the remaining group The members that are "failing" by turning in low numbers may have health reasons for those low numbers injuries or motivational problems It would be important as an educational tool for the public to NOT eliminate these players but to show how to over come these problems Real people in the real world HAVE these type of issues and so need to know how to work around these issuesTo increase the money for the program allow viewers to contribute toward prizes Give prizes for work out goals Give a prize for everyone that hikes bikes and or swims a set number of  miles this week These are possible examples Individualize the goals for each of these exercises to where is is a REASONABLE goal for each contestant A contestant that can not walk as far due to age or injury should not "fail" because the goals were set for younger healthier players Contestants may get toward the end of their day and be tired but  know that if they just swim bike and or walk for a bit they can earn points toward a reward Don'T make this a competitive thing with ONLY one winner Allow the contestants to encourage all to succeed in thisOffer prizes for trying new types of exercise Could they try rollerblading cross country skiing or reach a goal on a new piece of exercise equipment Let the contestants review new exercise equipment to show which things are fun even for over weight people  Allow viewers to suggest things to try via the web siteUse the show web site to allow viewers to ask for product reviews Do not bias that data by allowing company sponsor payment One week maybe review the contestants favorite low calorie salad dressing choices or lean meat choices Discuss running shoe choices for overweight exercisers Allow sponsers to donate things to try but the winners should be chosen by the contestantsSuggest various potential prizes on the web site and ask for donations When enough donations are reached to pay for that prize it is availableAllow viewers to pay a set amount in pledge for body fat loss For example allow viewers to purchase credits that they may then bestow at a given rate such as a dollar a pound for each pound of body fat loss Allow viewers to bestow multiple such credits on their favorite contestant and/or to also distribute out these credits to multiple players they are followingAllow viewers that don't have money to donate to pledge their weight loss pounds toward special prizes for their contestant For example if a contestant could encourage their fan base to lose and report a hundred pounds of documented (in a physicians office) loss of body fat that  should be grounds for a prize for that contestantGranted until additional air time could be purchased the additional footage regarding product reviews could be largely available on the web site Also consider adding there reviews of new medical research and studies regarding obesityPut the cost of having an additional trainer on the web site and let the viewers decide if we can come up with donations to cover the cost Weight loss is SO important that the more people that can be put through the process the betterConsider allowing medical personnel to come and work with doctor Hand or the trainers Medical shows of personnel in training are popular What are the issues day to day for someone training to be a weight loss specialist? That would educate the members of the medical profession AND the public on these issuesAllow members of the public that join the web site for the fee to buy sponsorships for those that can not afford the fee The sponsors could become team leaders for their scholarship recipientsThe bottom line for me is that this should should be about people encouraging one another and their fan base to lose weight in a safe manner Obesity is a HUGE killer in this country This show is a beginning but could be much better Stop basing the show on those generic reality show formats where someone has to failI agree with the previous reviewer that the show should encourage exercise that is safe I have seen contestants lift very heavy objects over head Even when the contestants OPENLY complain of back pain and or shoulder pain the exercise was not stopped for them If a contestant complains of back or joint pain please STOP the event for themI have seen a contestant attempt to pass out to the floor and be HELD UPRIGHT (NEVER DO THIS) Please review the proper treatment for syncope and for possible heart attack in the field I did not see an available lifepack anywhere in the gym nor see it applied with this near syncope episode These people are NOT healthy A life pack should be available for all workouts with NO exception I have seen one ankle injury on the show because a contestant was asked to step up and down off a weight bench with legs that stuck out laterally This was an accident waiting to happen Please have potential exercises reviewed for safety BEFORE trying them with contestants I have seen contestants begin to throw up when running repeatedly up a hill in  degree heat No one stopped them and treated them for heat exhaustion The show pulls some dangerous stunts Do not injure these people for ratingsPlease honor cultural issues Young men in many cultures reach an age where they prove manhood They train for this among other men They are uncomfortable going through this process with a female Respect this Some young women are uncomfortable training and sweating with a male present Allow the clients to choose their trainer as they would in the real world Allow them to change traners as they find the need If they reach a point where they feel THEY are not making progress they SHOULD try something else ie a change in trainers temporarily or permanently Allow the trainers to suggest contestants try a new trainer for a new perspective to for example get over a weight loss plateau or perhaps to get additional views on the weight loss process Allow contestants to split their sessions If they want to work with one trainer for aerobics and a different trainer for weight training thats fine They may want even a different instructor for balance training flexability training or for training for an individual sportHelp contestants find a sport they love This typically leads to keeping the weight off if they continue their beloved sport after they have lost the weightWith all this said I consider this show a beginning Start from here and improve Its a VERY important show regarding a VERY important health problemKatherine Rogers MD
20.0  Ipad nd generation Great quality with no skips/distortion too bad you can only watch with wifi Worth the price whether hi def or not
20.9  There has never been a better children's television show ever It ushered in the new wave of children's television and set the standard These days cheap cgi is mostly used along with terrible story lines and boring writing The result is  a Stepford like coma drawn in muted colors It is pretty bad out thereSo buy buy Blues Clues Buy every season Steve Burns has never been given the credit he deserves for his charming and rich character as Steve Nick Balaban and Mike Ruben are masterful songwriters adding scores that rival any broadway tune Angela Santomero Traci Paige Johnson And Todd Kessler should all be given The Leonardo Da Vinci World Award of Arts recognition There should be shrines ParadesWhy am I so passionate about Blues Clues? I have logged SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOURS of watching children's television programs I am an expert I have been watching children's television for  years and I kind of know my stuff I didn't even have to look up their names I KNOW THEMSo trust me on this This is a timeless show that needs no help from my review But there it is
1.79  The history of the Daylight is most informative The complete history is given and one of the more interesting highlights is the cost from LA to San Francisco Look carefully at the posters For those interested in locomotives and the speed they could obtain this might be an eye opener Enjoy if you light steam
21.75  Its pretty funny that a one minute free trailer clearly labeled &#;TRAILER&#; is getting bad reviews because its just a one minute free trailerI thinkas far as one minute free trailers go its pretty good Its  seconds long which is what one expects from a one minute trailer and the price is zero which is also what one expects from a free trailerThese things combined I'm satisfied with this one minute free trailer that is clearly labeled &#;TRAILER&#; :)
21.75  We truly enjoyed the show Good bye  Matt Smith--what a great send off!  Well worth the price of the DVD
21.75  I have loved Doctor Who since the mid-eighties and was thrilled when Russell T Davies brought it back and delivered a stunning four new seasons  Under Steven Moffat though the quality of the show has steadily gone downhill even while the cost and the revenues from a rapidly expanding audience have been going upThe Time of the Doctor the finale of Season  and of Matt Smith's time as the Doctor was absolutely disappointing  Where Davies was great with bold epic adventures Moffat just delivers better for a small intimate show like Blink  He not only didn't pull off an epic ending here he showed himself to be a tease after years of buildup and completely unable or unwilling to deliverNow as I look at the recently announced pre-order price for Season  (double the cost of previous years) I've grown sick of the ego and apparent greed of the BBC and Moffat  Maybe it is time to let the Doctor rest in peace  As much as I was looking forward to Peter Capaldi's version of the Doctor if Time of the Doctor is any indication of the low production and story values that can be expected at inflated prices this just might be the first year that I stop watching  I'll go back and watch Tom Baker era shows when they didn't have money turned out great stories year after year (not at will when not working on other shows) and The Doctor was great even with cheesy special effects and a metal dogSteven Moffat should quit DW and go make shows that he is better at like Coupling or Jekyll and not degrade Doctor Who any farther  He seems less than committed to the show as it is with too many other projects going to make DW as a regular series  The show doesn't need another JJ Abrams type thinking he is clever when delivering inconsistent poorly thought out junk that alienates the fans of the show who have been around longer than the reign of the current head writer  That's how Doctor Who got cancelled before
21.75  More then met my expectations And Amazon got it to me very fast and at a great price and suggested other things I might want to buy along with it
21.75  I couldn't wait for the release or delivery as I never pay full price but still like to get things early(nudge nudge wink wink) After the awesomeness of The Day of the Doctor I just had to get this one NOW So I bought it! It was Amazingly cheap $ and I get to keep it forever! Man this is the first time I see myself both excited and unable to predict what the future of DW holds There's gonna be a long wait for anything New but for the now I can satisfy my fix with this It's soooo good! The cracks in time the Silence the Timelords they all return and we get the most amazing reboot and regeneration blast since  well  the last one The only question now is What will Capaldi bring us?
21.75  It was too manic (fast paced) and forced it was emotional and moving but did not give Matt Smith his due It was all like a really expensive sketch The regeneration was flawed The th Doctor should have arrived on the tower not as a hiccup
21.75  I was dissapointed that the story was so lacking for this Dr's transition The last change was an epic build-up and really great send off This just felt more like a cheap way to write off the need for the Dr to have more &#;lives&#; Just a letdown to what was a great run
21.75  LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE the Doctor!I most definitely enjoyed watching this for the price it is!I can't say much more because the rest would just be spoilers! ^~
21.75  Once upon a time you could click 'Buy TV Pass' to buy every episode of a season and to pay only for new episodes of the specified show--if there were 'extras' like trailers or behind-the-scenes specials they were either included with your Season Pass for free or they were kept separate from the normal episodes Likewise if you were buying individual episodes you could trust that if there was a new episode listed in a season and it cost the full price of an episode--it was an episode of the season of the TV show in questionThese former conveniences no longer apply 'Seasons' no longer contain all the episodes of a season Additionally 'seasons' also contain things which are NOT episodes of the specified show--things which used to be free extras or which are repurposed from different shows entirely but which are now priced individually and for as much as individual episodes of the related show In some cases (see also "Doctor Who Season ") Amazon will now bundle as many as *a dozen* extras together with A SINGLE EPISODE of a TV show call it a 'Season' and charge full price (or more!) for all the extras none of which are the show named at the top of the page This way they can charge the unknowing buyer as much as $ for a single episode of a TV Show and a dozen "special features" they had no reason to expect would be includedLook only as far as the difference between "Season " and "Season " of the 'TV Show' this is a review of to see how things have been skewed: The show (for "Season ") was called "Doctor Who: Matt Smith Specials" and it contained all the special episodes and related extras (trailers prequels) which fit that description from Dec  through the apparent policy change in Fall  Then the next special episode of Doctor Who (featuring Matt Smith) 'Day of the Doctor' got its own season--and  separately-charged-for extras were tacked on to it And now the final special episode of Doctor who (featuring Matt Smith) 'Time of the Doctor' has also got its own season marked "Season " as though this single episode were equal to  years' worth of other specials and oughtn't simply have been added as the th (or th) episode of "Doctor Who: Matt Smith Specials"--adding of course that it's already got  separately-charged-for extras each at the same price as the episode itself Perhaps in the coming days they will find a way to inflate this "season" with a few more full-price "episodes" to match the travesty of 'Day of the Doctor'This review does not refer to the content of the two paid extras included in this "season" 'Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor' or 'Farewell to Matt Smith' but to the actual Doctor Who episode 'The Time of the Doctor' its trailer and to the "season" as a whole (Note: It is not currently possible to review a single episode of a TV show on Amazon; one may only review the entire season) I would give perhaps  stars to the content of the episode itself but must take away at least one star for each unnecessary component included in the "season" If it were allowed for me to review the business practices which created the customer-unfriendly situation described above I would certainly have been compelled to give ZERO or one star--but since that is not allowed I will fairly review the product I have been offered a "season" consisting of one actual episode and several unnecessary paid extras ((Note: After some research I want to clarify that this is definitely a problem with *the product* and not the *retailer*--these shows are being improperly packaged/bundled/sold across multiple channels not just Amazon Instant Video))
21.75  Let's get the worst out front and in the open***SPOILERS FOLLOW***it's pointlessTo be blunt the series has been heading towards this for some time and it is clear that with the th Special and now this Christmas Special what we are being told is this: it's over  The original series of DOCTOR WHO has come to its conclusion with the th Doctor be revealed as the th and everything we came understand was nothing more than a lie  There was no st Time War there was no grim choice made by the Doctor Gallifrey was not destroyed nor were the Daleks (I'm not even sure now if this new timeline even acknowledges that the Daleks were also changed - I didn't see one iDalek anywhere near this battle) and all the loose ends were tied neatly together and brought to an endMerry ChristmasThe special was loud long explosive empty filled with tears (all Clara did was cry - over her turkey over the Doctor over her crappy family) and insights and in-jokes and a great performance by Matt Smith - who to me took to the role of the Doctor even better than the th and th Doctor - David Tennant (please note from now on - we have to give them their proper numbering - the th Doctor was the th the th was the th and th to boot - as he threw away one regeneration on the human Doctor and the th was the th and what a mess)  He was and remains a natural and has risen to the top five of my favorite Doctor's - but his run of stories never did him any real favorsBig ideas grand plans all of it and more on top of that and in truth - it was too heavy and impossible to pay off  I know they brought it all back to square one but the thing that really annoyed me and brought the special down was this: THERE IS NO RISK AT ALL IN BEING THE DOCTOR  Time can be rewritten the universe can be destroyed and recreated every event that ever was can be altered at any point on a any whim - nothing from this point going forward with the new series can be looked upon as being impossible or outside the Doctor's power - he is the ultimate being in the universe and that is boringHow do you generate suspense for someone who can alter all of reality who's companion exists at every point in time in the Doctor's life and can save him at any moment?I'm not sure - but I will tune in to find out with the st / ht Doctor to see what they have in store - but it's mainly me being dragged though into watching itso instead let's talk about the good for a moment: funny  I laughed  Emotional: I did tear up here and there and mainly over Matt Smith and him being allowed to age  years and become his own version of the Celestial Toy-maker - real nice loved the hand drawn pictures of the Doctor's  year battle and if you pause often enough you will see some really nice moments  I did love the return of Amy she was important to the series and without her it wouldn't have felt complete  It looked great the cast was great there were great moments butit was a dodge  It couldn't own up to it's promise and again like the th Special - it needed to once more reboot the whole franchise to clean up the scripted mess the series has become  They wasted regenerations rewrote all the most basic and prime rules of the series for cheap drama and it shows clearly like a crack in the wall  I have no issue with Gallifrey returning and even the reset on the regeneration cycle was made clear in THE FIVE DOCTORS - they offered The Master a new run of lives so the power exists to make it happen it's just they don't do it to avoid what Borusa was aiming for: immortalityin the end the Doctor got the prize but will there be a real price for it?  One viewer with me said the new Doctor now has "lives to burn" - so the show should be more excitingYeah - nothing like never dying makes living more exciting
21.75  I love Doctor Who and when it finally released in the US last year for streaming I did the happy dance! However I repeatedly purchase the streaming episodes from another provider because they disclose the cost of their season price; whereas Amazon does not Amazon please change your policy around telling me exactly how much an entire season will cost I'd like to keep all my episodes and movies in one place
21.75  Love the fact the amazon has this amazing series and the best part is that it's all for the price of a prime membership!
21.75  I feel like the price was ridiculous but I love Dr Who so I needed to watch these episodes to catch up
21.75  First let me preface by saying I've followed Doctor Who through most of it's lifetime never got that excited about itThen there was the whole Russel Davies resurrection of it and I was hooked  It jumped the shark a lot over the seasons many omg what were they thinking moments but if you twisted your "head" just right it was a pretty enjoyable experience and I've watched seasons - multiple times and not regretted the price of admittance (Amazon for a lot of it)Season  enjoyed it though was getting a might tired with the "and then there was a paradox and everyone lived happily ever after"  Moffat I've loved his stuff Hyde and Sherlock being two series well worth watching  Though admittedly several years later I still puzzle over HydeThat said  This season for whatever reason they're doing "small stories" that winds up being pretty boring and predictable  They're getting rid of Amy and Rory (that's happened in an episode that's aired already so not viewing that as being a spoiler of any sort) and they wind up spending way too long with everyone giving each other long sad looks BoringIn this specific episode plot was predictable their work on having the Doctor being at a "darker" place since he's been wandering around without companions a lot doesn't work all that well  The cyborg in the episode well I think I could come up with something better lookingAlien ship lands in the old west in the USCyborg looking for the doctordoctor and companions show upI'm being kind by giving it two stars and no have no desire to see the episode again just not that much fun
21.75  This is just a few minutes long and should therefore not be at the same price as a full episode Seriously regret clicking the link without reading the review Misleading labeling as a 'prequel' its a long cliffhanger commercial I expect more honest pricing Amazon
21.75  Love all the Doctors from the reboot of this series! Season  doesn't disappoint :-) The clarity is good for online streaming I just finished watching Seasons - on the &#;red&#; streaming website Had to get my fix for Season  on Amazon Worth the price per episode I'll be back for more episodes
21.75  This episode was incredible as all of the episodes in this season have been thus far The minuscule price for getting to watch Dr Who up to current season is nothing compared to having to wait a full year to see the latest Whovian activities (as I was forced to last year only having Netflix with no cable tv available) The cowboy aspects in this episode are quite amazingly done and the guest appearance by Ben Browder as the Sheriff made for a wonderful surprise and a compelling character The mix of the main character of what was one of my favorite Sci-Fi shows (Farscape) and the Doctor made me ecstatic Altogether even with the decline of Rory and Amy being entirely transparent (as one of their closing lines in the episode hints at) the Doctor and his adventures are coming back to the main spotlight of the show to replace what had become a series of Rory and Amy episodes with the Doctor stepping back to let them have their moments I will certainly miss the duo however the return of focus on the Doctor his adventures and the startling alien insights on humanity is certainly inspiring me to settle in with the Doctor for decades to come
21.75  No spoilers here It's a good beginning to the latest season I enjoy the doctor thoroughly  The price of purchase was reasonable and well worth the expenditure
21.75  I started watching Doctor Who in  when it first came back on but lost track of it I've been catching up on what I've missed since then Netflix is good for that But they didn't have season  and I wanted to be ready for the second half of the season This was the least expensive way I could find of seeing the episodes before the second half started It's fantastic! I've laughed and cried and even gasped out loud a time or two! Definitely worth it!
21.75  These are some of the BEST episodes with the Ponds!C'mon everything from the Daleks to dinosaurs to the Weeping Angels and even the old West!I loved every episode as it includes some of the best parts of the Doctor series This lot of six episodes has a lot of cool stuff jammed into it It's a must for every Doctor fan and it's the last of the Ponds as the Doctor's companions before we see Clara Even Rory's dad get's in on the act for some of the ride Addicting and worth the price of admission highly recommend!
21.75  I couldn't watch this on any webpage and got frustrated! No BBC in America due to the insane cost of cable so seeing it online at my leisure was great!!  Love the 'Ponds'!  Sorry to see them go! Can't wait for the next part of the season!  :)
21.75  Since I was catching up on season  I missed the airing of the beginning of season  I decided to buy it on here which was a great choice The episodes were cheap and worked just fineI am a huge fan of Doctor Who and I must say that I couldn't have been happier with the way this season began
21.75  As a loyal fan of Doctor who (as a matter of fact I was born the month they started filming it in ) I have enjoyed the extremely clever and dedicated story work of this television phenomenon  However starting about  seasons ago and now with the new season opener it is becoming clearer that the writers and producers of this show need a major makeover  But alas for some reason the BBC does not like to ever let go of their writers and producers on certain shows regardless of the cost inflicted on the story-lines  The burned out talent keeps coming back year after year  Steven Moffit is a prime example! He should stay on his only passion which is the new Sherlock Holmes where he not only belongs but is obviously vesting all of his talents into  Russell Davies is another Please BBC put them out of their misery and get some fresh talent for our Doctor(s)  There has to be more than two writers in England that can do a Doctor Who story!!!! Gads give the show to the Americans if you are giving up on itThere was a time you could NEVER guess how the Doctor's adventures would end now they are not only predictable its getting so very stale and so over the top it's comical  Sudden magical endings are becoming the norm instead of showing a bit more creativity to the story plots  Ending an episode quickly with rubbish filling up  minutes of it seems to be very acceptable these days  "The Impossible Astronaut: episode is typical of this style of writing It made no sense and leaves you feeling the story was a big rush job all the way to the finishFor the first time over these past  seasons I am just buying one episode at a time because this brilliant show may be writing itself out of existence I pray not Many times now I find myself wanting to watch with only the dependable and well produced shows from the 's - 's or seasons  -  as they were more enjoyablePlease don't get me wrong I am a true "Doctor Who" Fanboy The first season all the way through to David Tennent who was as talented as the Doctor as someone of Tom Baker's caliber (on the whole) positively brilliant  But just because your fanatical about this series as a whole doesn't mean it stays a staple of true science fiction cult TV forever more!I am really hoping with the change of Amelia Pond as a companion the stories might start getting better since it's obvious she is the worst companion in years right up there with "DoDo" who suddenly lost her East End accent after just a few episodes just before they fired her (she got on the Doctor's nerves too)  Anyway a good overall way to tell when a series like this is in trouble is when the stories have to keep returning to the same arch villains of the doctor especially the Daleks WHAT A SURPIRSE season seven opened up with a Dalek story how buggery amazing was that!It's as though the writer or writers agree they have nothing new so lets do yet ANOTHER predictable Dalek story and have a go with the same type of beginning predictable middle boring ending as most of the episodes of the last few seasons It's as though they are saying to us fans "I don't know what to do anymore with this show lets throw a Dalek in and they will mindlessly eat it up regardless of story content"  I am sorry BBC but even in America we do care about the franchise "Doctor Who" and can tell bad from good writingI am not saying EVERY show is god awful but the last few seasons well over half of them I could have slept through  The only reason I didn't was because I kept trying to convince myself it WILL get better just keep watching I mean what were they thinking when they wrote: "Let's Kill Hitler????"  Though I believe tt really all started rollarcoasting downhill with "The Impossible Astronaut" at the very beginning of last seasonIn the meantime I will keep praying that the show makes a CREATIVE come-back on the true standing it once had  I mean the last show I can remember feeling moved by and enjoyed was "The Doctor and Vincent" episode  As a fan-boy of the show I just cannot bring myself anymore to keep cheering every season on mindlessly and pretending that quality shows don't matter as much as the story around the famous character himselfBy the way those of you who are fans and think highly of the start of this creative series but think Steven Moffit its current writeris totally devoted to Doctor Who had this to say about Doctor Who's start in the 's: "If you look at other stuff from the Sixties they weren't crap -- it was just Doctor Who The first episode of Doctor Who betrays the lie that it's just the Sixties because the first episode is really good -- the rest of it's sh_t"  Hmmm If it wasn't for the hard work and dedication of William Hartnell and cast we wouldn't have the Doctor today Real Nice dedicated guy hmmm? This comment can be found at just by going to the Wikia of Steven Moffit  I tried to put on the link but Amazon removes themThank you for taking the time to read my review
21.75  I am so frustrated  From the title and price I assumed it was a half length ( min) episode of Doctor Who  It was not  It was a  minute preview of the first episode  Every single shot in this preview is in the full length episode  DO NOT BUY THIS
21.75  I am really glad that i bought this series It was a good price and it is a good show
21.75  as usual I always end up liking the new doctor after every regeneration I'm about  Dr behind at any given time good quality love the price thumbs up
21.75  Steven Moffat wrote some very good Doctor Who scripts before he became the head writer Back then I assume someone was editing his work to remove the contradictions plot holes clich&eacute;d dialogue ("How bad is it? Out of ten eleven!") and hamfisted schmaltz (see the entire "subtracting love" dialogue between Amy and Rory in this episode)Contradictions are rife in the Moffatt era: Do you remember the episode where the Doctor boasts that he can visit his friends at any point in their lives and  seconds later is moping because he phoned someone after they'd died? The current writing team doesn't care about inconsistencies as long as they provide a handy plot point or draw a cheap tear This season premiere is no exception [***SPOILER ALERT:***] Early in the story we learn that the conversion consists of wiping and archiving people's memories and then giving them a new personality with no access to the old one Then halfway through we get this contradictory pap about "subtracting love and adding anger" as if this were a Cyberman script for no other reason than that Moffatt wants to explore Amy and Rory's feelings for each other and update us about what's happened to them It's convenient so it's okay to contradict what you said not  minutes earlier Regarding that same scene it's worth noting that there's a very fine line between emotional depth and schmaltz and this scene is on the wrong side of itFinally [****MAJOR SPOILER ALERT:****] this episode has yet another person-resisting-conversion plot twist (we've had them in recent Cyberman stories too) which is part of the broader Moffatt-era notion that if you wish hard enough and love deep enough the laws of physics will be suspended long enough for whatever you're wishing for to happen Screaming "I am human" as someone is "subtracting your love" and "adding anger" and presumably cutting out your brain to shove it in a pepper pot doesn't seem like it would harm the conversion process one iota C'mon this is Doctor Who not Peter PanIt's good to see the show back from hiatus: I love the cast love the characters and I almost like the premise of this episode But I was really hoping the scripting would be less slipshod this season I like a lot of Moffatt's pre-Doctor Who writing (especially Coupling) and I can't for the life of me figure out why he's approaching this series the way he is
21.75  I had hoped to avid the long buffering times and low video quality of illegally uploaded episodes of Dr Who on amazon Sadly this video was watchable but no where near worth the price I paid to watch it Only slightly more reliable then your average video site and with a price tag Just to make it clear my computer runs videos on Netflix and youtube wonderfully it even plays most video games online with no lag thus it seems that the video streaming program was the problem I going to stick with google and perseverance from here on for my whovian fix
21.75  Season  (particularly the second half) were not well written and production seemed cheap and rushed compared to past seasonsAs far as the show goes the Impossible Girl story line is boring
21.75  This season is only two episodes in and I am already loving it Can't wait until next Saturday for the next episode!Amazon instant video is a great way to catch episodes you miss of any show you might like!At a good price too!!
21.75  As far as I am concerned this series of Doctor Who definitely lives up to its predecessors  There is a lot of Who here  Many individual episodes each of which is full of humor joyous plot devices excellent writing surprises and each of which advances the overarching plot  Definitely worth the cost of admission
21.75  I feel appalled disgusted and betrayed by this episode and the turn that this entire season has taken  A formerly rich and complex show that inspired us emotionally and mentally to do better things and be better people now relies on cheap tricks and one-liners The special effects though flashy serve only as a poor mask of the hollow plot  To add insult to injury the comic relief treats the audience as children consistently turning a potentially touching moment or harrowing escape into a cheesy diversion from the lacking story-line  The main characters have also been stripped of their complexity  Our Doctor once portrayed as the greatest genius this universe has ever known has been replaced by a clown  There was no development for him there was no struggle there wasn't even a hint of danger throughout And don't even get me started on Clara suffice it to say flat  I feel cheated  I wasted my time and money on what should have been a sci-fi adventure  Instead I received what amounts to a kid's show and a poor one at that
21.75  You can't lose Much better writing than our American  'go for the quick dollar' cheap productions The BBC always does quality work
21.75  A great show As always good story without high cost productionThis one was across between Star Trek and Twilight Zone
21.75  Another classic Experience with amazon player was great and price was reasonable since bbc won't let us yank in on past episodes online Oh well
21.75  I decided to give the show four stars instead of five because of the quality of video and streaming speed  The interface was easy to use and price is good considering how interesting of a show Dr Who is
21.75  The show was great the delivery of this content was also well done  I think the price was fair  Thumbs up
21.75  Loved the season and you can't beat it for that price! Very well made and hilariously entertaining! A must have!
21.75  I'm not a big fan of this doctor and these episodes are really not very good  I'm a life-long Dr Who fan grew up watching them in England and on PBS when we moved to the US I had to start buying them since Fios doesn't carry BBC America until the super expensive package Bought this a few weeks ago and honestly have not gotten around to watching them all the way through because I have been kind of bored by the first few episodesThe old episodes are classic (Tom Baker is the best Doctor ever) and out of the new ones I enjoyed the ones with Tennant as Doctor and Billie Piper as Rose the most Hoping next season is better
21.75  Who doesn't love Dr Who?  Worth the price to buy Season & Part  because we just couldn't wait for it to come out on-line!
21.74  As the holiday specials aren't included in the pt or pt bluray/dvd sets  this worked out really well for me and it was much more cost effective
21.74  I agree we shouldn't be charged  hopefully I'll be refunded for the prequel  I used the simple find a lower price form  if anyone else got the season pass and wants to go that route you can use this for the URL:  [] and then just enter $ for the price and the shipping  also don't understand why the christmas special itself isn't up yet  maybe they made a mistake and thought they were putting it up when they put $$ for the prequel?
21.74  It is ridiculous that I paid money for a clip that I have already seen for free elsewhere The actual episode better be included in this price when it becomes available which better be soon!
21.74  The Doctor Who Series Seven Part One is very good  However the case is very cheap and shoddy  When I opened it the case it had already broken/
21.74  I love the Doctor Who series so since I just moved and no longer want to pay for cable TV I was glad to find the Christmas special available here for only a couple bucksAnd since I love Doctor Who of course I liked the episode That's why I am focusing this post on the price and availability
21.74  Thrilled that we can find ALL the episodes here! Now who was the genius at BBC that decided to box the specials outside of the standard series? The Christmas specials are always SxE! Thus people get lost using that net flicker thingy and miss out on David Tenant at his best In case you're looking for that it's aptly named 'Doctor Who - David Tenant Specials' Yeah before those specials the Christmas specials were included as the launch for the new season! Apparently Matt felt he needed the Tenant treatment Was he out doing 'Hamlet' with Patrick Stewart? No Didn't think soOh well The specials are good The Prime price is just right for this It's a rip that BBC didn't include these in the regular season DVD/BD boxes
21.74  I love Doctor Who! But we don't subscribe to any television service so in the past I've had to wait until they were released on DVD I found these on Amazon though and now I only have to wait until the day after air! And the price isn't bad :)
21.74  It's hard to figure this drama out since it resembles nothing produced in the US It's quirky Things appear out of nowhere Fake snow in London Is it real snow or fake Who knows? It's not the snowman with teeth eating homeless men that is the freakish; it's the falling fake snow in London It's really quite stilted as well - introducing child characters with perfect looks perfect manners a perfect nanny who is wealthy enough to wear expensive clothingThe British are certainly different: Monty Python A woman walking around in with a green snake face with her female accomplice in a dark alley with fake snow attempting to corner Dr Who The female lead is a bar maid with a make up assistant on hand to apply make up through out even though she's likely poverty stricken That's what we most notice about most bar maids they look like Esmerelda in the Hunchback of Notre Dame And they don't care about their jobs They care about fake snow and chasing unattractive British men in the dark of night - and keeping their face looking makeup perfect At least get a bar maid actress with a Cockney accent not a perfect BBC one Couldn't she at least fake a Cockney accent?
21.74  Previously prequels and short blips like this have been freeVery disappointed at the cost of a two min blip  Can't wait for the fullSpecial though
21.74  You have to like Matt Smith! or not but hey that's cool too (As long you like Tenant instead) But seriously if you have trouble figuring out if you want to get this or not I would say maybe Based on a) how much you like Dr Who (or Matt Smith) and b) how much money you have  You don't get a ton of content here but if you are a Who fan like myself it's worth the price for sure
21.74  The Doctor Who Christmas specials just can't seem to fail!  Every single one stands out even among the entire Dr Who series  The  Christmas Carol immediately became both mine and my wife's favorite version of the classic Dickens tale  As in the rest of the series the writers just take time travel to an entirely new and mind-bending level  We bought these episoes for no more than the price of a one night rental and our family will watch them over and over through the years!
21.74  Let me set something straight  I love Doctor Who  I have watched every episode available from the First Hartnell to the latest Matt Smith  My cable system and PVR let me down and didn't record this years Christmas Special (wasn't marked &#;new&#; apparently) so kudos to Amazon for having it available to purchase and stream (can I get a round figure on what it would cost to own all of the Doctor this way? Less than  figures please) Doctor Who remains Doctor Who whether we're talking about Hartnell's Captain Kangaroo delivery Pertwee's  flamboyancy Tom Baker's charming teeth and curls or Matt Smith doing a fair impression of Troughton's second doctor  It's all British it's all time traveling entertainment on a grand scaleWatch this one it's goodHowever I write this post because once again I'm sent a message by Amazon asking me &#;how many stars I would give this show&#;  The same hook they use each time I purchase ANYTHING  From a song to a book to a movie that  years old; to this film (which could probably benefit from a positive review) and each time I fall for the hook and wander over here it's demanded of me that I wax verbose on the subject of whatever it is  If I've purchased a single song I cannot leave a review without writing an essay about it!  That is simply ridiculousPlease  Please I'm begging here Remove the requirement that essays be written for each and every product that you purchase just so you can give an 'attay boy' to something that deserves it without having to struggle with wit and punctuation and heaven forbid CAPS LOCK  Let us just give a star rating please?  At least quit pretending in your e-mails that a star rating is all you want
21.74  If you're looking for an awesome way to spend an hour or so this is a great way to go I loved every second of this special even though I watched it in May xD Well worth the small price I paid Bravo!
21.74  So happy to have AmazonVOD as we don't have a TV with stations cable or satellite It's a decent price for not having to wait to see such a great show!
21.74  In the past prequels and other short content has been free with the TV pass  Now they've decided to charge full episode price for a  second clip that has been available various places on the Web for a couple of weeks  I'm fine with auto-purchasing full episodes but getting charged $ for this is absurd
21.74  This is not an episode  It's the teaser that's available on the net for free  Why are they charging for this at all let alone the cost of a full episode?
21.74  Always a great show!  The amazon download process was easy and quick and a great price! Thanks for supporting all of us Whovians!
21.74  This is the best set of stories of Dr Who that's been made so far In these last four stories for David Tennant he plays the Doctor in a very different light Instead of the usual super hero that you cheer for and relate to David Tennant plays the Doctor going astray Instead of following his own moral codes of conduct he decides to throw it away and tries to be on the dark side He does it because it was too painful for him to see all the people he loves and cares for get hurt by his actions Instead of coping with all the choices he paid to save the world and the universe he decides instead to play god  He tries to alter history in a big way to suit his own carnal pleasures that causes dire consequences You get to see how scary he can really getIn the first story you see the Doctor saving the world again but this time he does it without an assistant Because he paid a huge price for his last assistant Donna Noble to be with him he decides to do it solo He teams up with a mysterious thief to save the Earth but he doesn't ask her to be his assistant even though she wanted to Instead of arresting her for stealing a precious artifact from a museum he lets her go  This is the start of him playing godIn the three remaining stories you get to see the Doctor in his scariest moment  By playing god he tries to change human history to his own liking Only by a miracle history righted itself by someone he loves and cares for He realized his mistake by playing god and tries to save the human race again from his arch enemies dying in the process Then he regenerates and you get to meet the new Doctor for a brief time played by Matt SmithThis set of stories is a farewell to David Tennant as the Doctor There are also behind the scenes episodes for each story but I didn't watch them
21.74  Season four turns out to be better for this Dr Who Once he gets a companion to snap him out of his whiney other three season I did enjoy and watch this seasons show more than once The other seasons I just barely got through those things Clearly Dr Who's re-generation for a younger generation made him a whimp and a dope He has a time machine He has family--a grand daughter Let's get with the program peopleUnlike the other seasons you may even want to spend some money on just not too much Digital is great and cheap or borrow from a friend But see before you dole out any cash pleaseAuthentic Dr Who still rules Those shows are timeless New Dr Who will soon be gone and forgotten
21.73  I'm sure that I will be blasted by the company trolls who respond with the trite response of "Comment on products that you own"I love Doctor Who the Sixth season where I've been waiting for the complete series Blu-ray release!  I had hoped that the complete series release wouldn't be so costly as the sixth season has Part  and Part  releases  The BBC however is following the formula of other movie and TV studios where we're being asked to pay a price as if the sixth season had never been released yet!  (If you don't believe me look at how the Blu-ray releases of The Lord of the Rings theatrical and extended movies were priced when first released)Are the complete series extras really worth the additional $ price tag?!?  (Subjective question here especially for you company trolls)  If you do pre-order this then you'll hopefully be rewarded in future as your purchase generates revenues to keep paying for the production costs of Doctor Who  At least that's what I believeIf the pre-order price was lower I'd give my review  stars
21.73  Others have listed and reviewed the content on the discs  I am disappointed that there is commentary on less than half the episodes but I don't really buy the disc sets for the extras  I wanted to complete my set of the 'new' "Doctor Who" series even though I thought Series Six was weak in several spots compared to Series Five and the Russell T Davies episodesWith this particular set I am very disappointed with the quality of the packaging  Upon arrival I discovered that the middle spindles of the disc trays were broken out of the first four of the six discs  The first tray is also cracked from the corner into the center in two spots  This is probably because compared to the Series Five set the plastic used is thin and cheap  The case enveloping it also seems to be made of cheaper stock and shows a clear and permanent crease in the spineUnfortunately since I live in Mexico returning them to Amazon for a replacement that is not torn up would cost a lot more than just buying a new set  I wish they'd just charged a little more and not used cheap and inferior materials for the packaging
21.73  My DVR blew me off on this on Saturday  I made it all the way to Wednesday before I thought that $ was an acceptable price and paid up  I suppose I'd change that if I could  Unbelievable ep
21.73  I love Dr Who but not uncritically-- which you would have to do to enjoy this stinker Seriously there are so many plot holes and idiocies in this one it ranks right up (or rather down) there with the classic Star Trek episode "Spock's Brain" Don't pay for this ep unless you need a Dr Who episode to watch with friends and shout at the screen &agrave; la MSTK Given how much episodes cost to produce it saddens me that they wasted an episode on this drivel I've seen better written fan fiction not that that's setting the bar very high
21.73  They always say you never forget your first Doctor Eleven is mine (I've gone back and watched other Doctors and have loved them all) I loved everything about series six - most especially the reveal of who River Song is and what that means for our Doctor The extras are great (the Night extras were worth the price of the series!) Overall is that if you love Doctor Who buy the complete series and just settle in to run through every emotion you can think of Best show ever
21.73  As a long time Dr Who and British style Sci Fi fan I rejoiced in the resurgence of this show Red Dwarf is great fun and silly Dr Who under RT Davis (Dr's  and ) is spectacular  Russel T Davis's scripts were thoughtful cerebral and sometimes twisted true Sci Fi  Excellent  Most excellent  However there were some episodes that were just horror flicksfor example "Weeping Angels"  Turns out the author of that scare episode is now the head writer and it shows  Gone are the cerebral brain teasing paradoxes and in are the sometimes "B movie" monsters  Dr Who is no longer peaceful in tactics but even resorts to violence  The actors are wonderful but the story lines lack imagination My entire family is growing tired of the new Dr Who show (as are many of my friends) and we recently canceled BBC America due to the cost and lack of return on investment  We do watch the occasional episode like this one on a Prime trial  For hard core Dr Who fans I don't see this new direction the show has taken as being worth the time to watch  Those who like horror movies and simple scare tactics you may like this genre I am now only watching reruns of all the old Dr Who episodes back to the early years up through the th Dr
21.73  Pretty Expensive  dvd for one series  I bought the first five series for almost the price of this DVD
21.73  I preordered this item the first day it shown up on amazon @$ For some reason the price was bumped up but subsequently brought down to $ again That is a good price for this set It obviously includes the  regular series episodes it also includes: The final season of Confidential(cut-downs as in previous sets) A Christmas Carol Space & Time (CIN  Mini Episode) Death is the only answer (Mini episode written by junior school winners) Plus a list of other bonus features
21.73  I LOVE DOCTOR WHO!!!!!!!! Finding the sixth season at a reasonable price was shocking and amazing! I am so grateful to have it It works perfectly no scratches and arrived a day early Couldn't be more pleased!
21.73  Although I prefer David Tennant as The Doctor the stories in this season have been excellent Most have overlapping story lines that carry through from one episode to the next The couple that didn't were the weaker episodes but they were still enjoyable I've been surprised at how many episodes were two-part episodes and a little disappointed that it wasn't apparent until an episode would end that I needed to watch a second one to see the story wrap up This cost me some sleep on numerous nights as I couldn't just stop after one episode and would have to stay up to watch another
21.73  I suggest that you do not buy this product from Amazon They are not being careful as to whether or not they are selling a legal professionally produced item  I received this Dr Who the sixth season and it is very obviously a cheap copy  The disks are scratched the holders are clear (not dark blue as they should be) and are falling apart  The cardstock is cheap and not glossy the printing is not sharp as it should be It is nothing but a knock off  I have already complained to Amazon and am arranging to return this for a refund  I usually do business with Amazon to avoid this kind of problem---I am dismayed to find them selling phoney disks  And if Amazon is not selling them direct they are not be careful about what kind of product they are selling for another compnay  My advice is to get your Dr Who the Sixth season somewhere else
21.73  This is the *Complete* Sixth Series featuring everything from where the Complete Fifth Series leaves off It's not just Part :Doctor Who: Series Six Part One [Blu-ray] & Part :Doctor Who: The Sixth Series - Part  [Blu-ray] but also the Christmas SpecialDoctor Who: A Christmas Carol [Blu-ray] which preceded it The  episodes are as follows:A Christmas CarolThe Impossible AstronautThe Day of the MoonThe Curse of the Black SpotThe Doctor's Wife (not who you think)The Rebel FleshThe Almost PeopleA Good Man Goes to WarLet's Kill HitlerNight TerrorsThe Girl Who WaitedThe God ComplexClosing TimeThe Wedding of River SongSlightly more than the sum of the parts but to quote River Song "it's early days" and the price should go down from competition I have mine on order so I can capture any price drops :-)Also included are the following extras (for the first time available):Extras:Meanwhile in the Tardis feature - Newly filmed scenes telling what happens between the episodes:Bad Night (Runtime: m s)Good Night (Runtime: m s)First Night (Runtime: m s)Last Night (Runtime: m s)Up All Night (Runtime: m s)Comic Relief  mini episodes - Space and Time (Approx m; These are worth watching multiple times!)Prequels:The Impossible Astronaut (Runtime: m s)Curse of the Black Spot (Runtime: m s)A Good Man Goes to War (Runtime: m s)Let's Kill Hitler (Runtime: m s)The Wedding of River Song (Runtime: m s)Doctor Who Confidential featurettes - An inside look at each episode (Note: These are shortened versions of "Doctor Who Confidential" lasting about  minutes each not the original  minute versions shown only in the UK I've always been disappointed in this)Monster Files featurettes - Get under the skin and inside the minds of the new Doctor's most challenging opponentsAudio commentariesTrailers and Trails featureUPDATE (Oct th): What it does NOT contain is the "Doctor Who at the Proms " Special that was included with the Christmas Carol single While disappointing it is still nice to have the bevy of previously unreleased material
21.73  Season  with Matt Smith is by far the best of the new Dr Season  has its moments However I am amazed by the acclaims this new series has rousted Season  &  are the only seasons I would even approach suggesting are worth purchasing What they cost on Amazon instant video is far cheaper and you can pick out the better shows which are few and far between at times Still I can honestly pull out the vintage Dr and watch then turn around and find these so called 'New' shows are just rehacked from the old Dr Even in Season  the writers do try to weave a constant story stream through the whole season so maybe I should not expect fresh stories since that seems to be all they can come up with for re-inventing Dr Who Dr Who was an interesting icon of science fiction for British TV and the BBC yet the bottom line was dollar signs and they hacked the Dr up just like their horrific Cybermen renditions Where are the supposed rules and regulations regarding these epic horror feasts that run amok on the air?Dr Who is still an icon in the science fiction field and will still be around for a long long time  The New Dr however has no endurance and a really beefed up intro theme song adds little appeal when these New Drs will only be remembered for the time they are run The best advice here is save your money and borrow from the friend who did not read reviews or at least make sure its really really cheap $ an episode is better but for some episodes that is way too much Dr Who did save people and planets once upon a time and people need heroes just not villified heroes You can't have it both ways without having chaos and chaos is what you have here
21.73  What can you sayif you're a fan you will pay anything for the Matt Smith series  But with this I didn't have to  Good price and quick delivery
21.73  I bought this for my Grandsons birthday He loved itThis is his favorite series I felt the price was reasonable
21.73  I could buy the separate sets of "A Christmas Carol" + "Season  - Part " + "Season  - Part " for $!$ for a combined package is ridiculousI'll pass until the price comes down to something resembling reasonable
10.71  I enjoyed the format of the film and the reality of the folks trying out the lifestyle for a few weeks For myself I was really affected by the few minutes of horrific scenes of the factory farms I've watched Forks and Knives and Food Inc and wasn't affected much by either other than a sense of anger but Vegucated for some reason timing I believe affected me enough to say "Ok I'm done with meat"I was already doing a diet using the My Fitness Pal app and then I watched this film and it made me take my food in a whole different direction It's now been almost  months I believe since I've really purposely eaten meat As for the diary products I'm using Vegan items as much as possible but as you know it is hard to get away from all the dairy products out there and still eat something other than salad So I am % vegetarian and % vegan now The big thing is that I am not having issues missing any meat whatsoever hence what I mean by it just being the right time in my life apparentlyI now think about my shoes clothing etc as well I was already aware of the human toll that our desire for everything cheap in this country has brought about and now I'm just as concerned about us building our society on the blood of animals as well
10.71  Does anyone know is there a name/label created yet for people who don't eat inhumanly raised/caught meat?? I liked this documentary as I am new to self-educating myself on how BAD our "FOOD" is here in the USA of all countries And am very unhappy with what is happening to our food And I know the only way to change this is to start showing the demand for whole foods and humainly raised/caught meats I dont see myself becoming a vegetarian nor a vegan but I do want to become someone who only eats foods that are made the "Old Fashion" Farming ways I know we created this Monster with 'Supply and Demand'  And The Mass-Production Multi-billionair's wont change their ways until we Multi-Trillion shoppers change our waysI plan to be at least  of conscious shoppers (even though I know it will cost me a pretty penny) Until a label is created I am a "Anti-Frankenstein Food Consumer"
10.71  I didn't think I would like this documentary but I did I liked the hand-held camera and intimate style of the film but it did concern me how some of the things they were eating that they thought were vegan actually AREN'T! Being vegan is about being informed and aware of what is in your food french fries are usually fried in animal fat/ lard and are not vegan as well as baked beans cooked in pork by-products (because a lot of canned baked beans are) The film doesn't discuss these nuances or even outline what is or isn't vegan and the people ate these foods during their &#;vegan&#; challenge Also being vegan is an expensive lifestyle and the film doesn't mention that at all And your body goes through many changes during the transition to veganism like having to go to the bathroom more feeling hungry all the time etc I wish this documentary was more realistic and touched more on these realities
10.71  I liked the movie  Its was cute and straight forward and very informationalOne thing I did not like about it was when they were playing is it vegan or not  Oreos is not health food! It was like she wanted to push the processed foods like fake burgers fake hotdogs ect  Organic beef is better than that fake stuff!  Could have showed then have to make up there own veggie burgers!I work in a state correctional center's dietary  We feed  "repeat" costumers every meal!  I remain veggie for a year now  I make up my breakfasts and lunches and dinners twice a week  Everything is packed up and ready to grab and go and not processed!  Only my green smoothies are made daily  And its dirt cheap and not processed!  Homemade veggie/bean burgers quinao and veggie cassaroles lentils and brown rice steel cut oats and fruitall better than fake meatlooking productsJerry
10.71  This is a well-done and well-crafted documentary that follows the plot of "Supersize Me" but with a vegan twist  The filmmaker follows three meat-eaters over a six-week period as they switch to a vegan lifestyle while learning about the modern meat industryThere are many good arguments for a vegan lifestyle  Yes the meat industry is harming our environment (with carbon dioxide emissions) is disgusting cruel to animals and gives us unsafe food that makes us fat and unhealthy  And yes a vegan diet will make people fitter and healthier and happierBut there are some concerns about a vegan lifestyle that the film fails to address  First given the way the government subsidizes the fast food industry it's actually a lot more expensive for a family to support a vegan lifestyle than to eat out at MacDonald's everyday  A vegan lifestyle (along with eating organic locally-produced foods) is very affordable and accessible to a middle-class family much less so to poor families (where the majority of obesity cases occur)  Second a vegan lifestyle can -- especially among young teenage girls -- be a way to cover up anorexia and other weight loss disordersI think the film would be a lot more powerful and convincing if it came with caveats  But instead it just continues to hammer home the point that a vegan lifestyle is the best option out thereThat said for those who are interested in becoming a vegan this is an excellent introduction to the lifestyle
10.79  My grandchildren have enjoyed this DVD as they have always enjoyed Veggie Tales I received it fast in a good package and at a great price! Thank you!
3.93  We love umizoomi We were looking for a good price for some shows to download on my kindle This was perfect
3.97  Best cheap babysitter for my  month old Ever Hands down
3.98  I love having this HD quality movie at my finger tips! My twins love SophiaI can stop and start it anytime within seconds For the price I'm very very happy
3.98  Our  year old loves this movie and watches it over and over again  Well worth the price since she is completely entertained!
3.98  Very cute start to the series My kids and I have been watching the first season but haven't been able to find this beginning to the series on tv It's a great price for this mini movie and its great that we can stream it on multiple devises
11.74  I would highly recommend When Calls The Heart Season  to anyone who was watching the show  My Mom and I were unable to watch the show when it aired on TV so we purchased it here  We were both highly satisfied with the quality of our download  The only thing that I would be happier is if the download didn't include advertisements but that's a small inconvenience for the VERY reasonable price and high quality of the download that you get  We've had this show for several months and only watched it once but it's in our library if we ever want to watch it again
31.96  A great tv show for all ages Has plenty of drama action character development and enough humor to remind you it is still a cartoon Definitely some of the best animation you will find for a tv show with a stellar sound track to bootAmazon did me a solid by refunding me thirteen dollars for my preorder after the show hit a price drop upon release First time that I have had any company do that for me
31.96  If I'm being really honest I wasn't hugely impressed with the first season ofThe Legend of Korra Being such a huge fan ofAvatar: The Last Airbender(of which Korra is a sequel/spin-off) I felt that "Korra" was somewhat rushed and clunky in comparison not helped by the significant reduction of episodes that led to a more limited amount of time in which to tell the intended storyBut I was still looking forward to "Book Two: Spirits" hopeful that creators Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko could iron out the kinks and deliver a show that recaptured the magic of the original series And they did! Or at least they came extremely close though "Avatar" is probably too dear to my heart to ever be fully eclipsedFor those completely unfamiliar with the premise of the show here's the gist: set in an Asian-inspired fantasy world where certain people possess the ability to manipulate (or "bend") water air fire or water our protagonist Korra stands out as the only individual able to master all four elements This ability identifies her as the Avatar the reincarnated being whose task it is to maintain balance in the worldSet seventy years after the events of "Avatar: The Last Airbender" Korra is the reincarnation of Aang the last Avatar who saved the world from the threat of the Fire Nation and restored peace between the world's populations: the Fire Nation the Water Tribes the Earth Kingdom and the Air Nomads Reborn as our head-strong and now teenaged protagonist Avatar Korra struggles to reconcile her fighting prowess with her need to tap into her spiritual side an endeavour that becomes all the more pertinent when rumours of dark spirit attacks on various ships reach herReturning to her home in the South Pole along with her mentor Tenzin (Aang's grown son) and her boyfriend Mako Korra's happy reunion with her parents is cut-short when spirits attack the Winter Festival Realizing that her Uncle Unalaq's skill at communicating with spirits allows him to effectively stop their rampage Korra decides to apprentice herself to him in the hopes she'll uncover the reason behind the spirits' destructive behaviour foregoing the opportunity to continue her spiritual training with TenzinFrom there the narrative breaks roughly into three distinct storylines: Mako his brother Bolin and his ex-girlfriend Asami investigate several strange occurrences in Republic City Korra tries to deal with the eruption of civil war between the Northern and Southern Water Tribes and Tenzin and his family (his wife his adult siblings and his four children) try to relax in the beauty of the Air Temples ignorant of the turmoil that's happening elsewhere It's an effective strategy for the dispersion of the cast across several settings gives the show a real sense of scope with episodes often concentrating on one location and its characters before weaving them back together for the grand finaleIt might all feel a little directionless for the five or six episodes but it's at the mid-way point of the season that things click into focus The two-part episode titled "Beginnings" delves back into the origins of the Avatar and this alone is worth the price of the DVD set With a shift in art-style that exemplifies the journey back in time to a much earlier period of this world's history these episodes provide insight into the whys and wherefores of the very first Avatar explaining the source of his powers and the reasons behind his calling It contains beautiful animation vivid characterization and allusions to everything from the Greek myth of Prometheus to the films of Hayao MiyazakiIt really is a stunning piece of television and from this point on the show picks up exponentially Korra must travel into the spirit world to find the answers to the growing turmoil in the world and here the imaginations of the writers and animators seems to know no bounds Best described as Asian mythology meetsAlice in Wonderland Korra's adventures are truly a sight to behold - and yet are best left unspoiled for those yet to watch for themselves Let's just say that I'll never look at meerkats the same way againElsewhere we get to learn more about Tenzin's siblings Kya and Bumi (the other children of Aang and Katara from the original show) as well as watch Mako's unfolding investigation of eccentric businessman Varrick who he suspects might be more than what he seems With Bolin roped into the film industry (which provides a series of spoofs of serialized black-and-white movies complete with rudimentary special effects) and Asami trying to salvage what's left of her father's company Mako is left to grapple with the ineffectuality of his fellow police officersIt's not all perfect: some of the original characters are given short-shrift (Bolin becomes little more than comic relief embroiled in a rather disturbing relationship with Korra's cousin whilst Asami and Lin Beifong are repeatedly shunted to one side) Unalaq makes for a one-dimensional and entirely too-obvious villain and there are some animation sequences that look horribly rushed but for the most part this second season of "Korra" not only improves on the first but recaptures some of the feel of "Avatar: The Last Airbender"Korra is treated to some genuine character development there are plenty of fun nods to the original series and surprising cameos from past characters and it ends on a note that promises plenty more exciting storylines for the future Plenty of fan complaints seem to have been addressed and dealt with (the terminable love triangle the lack of consequences for Korra at the conclusion of last season) and it seems a good sign that the upcoming Book Three is titled "Change"
11.91  GREAT Show easy access with Amazon!!Great price and would highly recommend Amazon Instant Video to all!Each show is fun to watch very funny and I think I learn something new about the comic book world with each episodehighly recommend!!
11.91  love this show watched the first  seasons on Netflix and found season  on amazon def the best show one of my favorites just totally the perfect show to chill out on the couch and pretty much catch up on some memories of most the things they talk about and its funny watching  nerds almost sweating thinking as hard as they can to negotiate the price of some comic book or toy lmaoo its so important to them those negotiations alone have me watching the show
11.99  The price is perfect Definitely buy this one The show is also amazing and one of my favorites I love all the characters
11.99  This is one of my favorite anime  Picked this up from Amazon for a great price during their sales event around Christmas  Can't beat the price really for a pretty new series!This anime does not disappoint with the action plot or characters involved  They are diverse complex and goofy; without the blatant fanservice
11.99  I loved the manga for this series So I watched the epilog episodes and decided I wanted to own the collection The price was fair for  episodes I havent started watching it yet but it arrived in a timely fassion I was in perfect condtion upon arrival I checked all of the discs and none had any damage to them Overall I am pleased with Amazon for supplying my anime needs cheaply
11.99  For the price I paid for this awesome anime I was very very pleased If you haven't bought Soul Eater yet you should!
11.99  Great show arrived on time and it was super cheap for being the complete collection of soul eater I would definitely recommend this
11.99  This is one of the Anime standards everyone should watch The Action and Animation is great the story was great (minus the last episode trust me; everyone hates the last episode) and the characters are super memorable Every episode will have on the floor laughing or on the edge of your seat in excitement With how cheap it is now there is no excuse why you wouldn't buy it I hope this helps your decision
11.99  I started watching this on Toonami and couldn't wait to see the rest so i bought it! Came in great time and good condition really good price too glad i purchased it
11.99  Case slightly broken but discs in perfect shape great price for the series! I would definitely buy again I love this!
11.99  While I wasn't a fan of how they diverted from the source material / of the way through the series this is still most definitely worth it I mean the quality is great on Blu-ray and you are getting the entire series We're talking about + episodes of great fun and enjoymentThe extras aren't anything crazy They have the little shorts that aired with the original episodes now separated into their own section A couple episodes have cast members commenting Pretty much the usual for these kinds of thingsFor the price I say it's completely worth it You get the whole series in one package and hours upon hours enjoyment
11.99  This was a birthday gift for my grandson He LOVES this series He watched it on TV and missed several episodes Now he can watch it any and as many times as he wants He is pleased and so am I Delivery was timely price was right and packaging was secure
11.99  it is a very good show  eps good price  a a d d d f f f f f

11.99  I love this anime and much and getting it for so cheap made everything x better for me and my wallet~
11.99  The last time I have watched Soul Eater was in  on Hulu and FUNimation's Youtube channel and I found it to be extremely entertaining But this review isn't about the show itself It's about the prices FUNimation so far has released three versions of this series The first releases were in four parts (Part - contains  episodes and Part  contains the remaining  episodes)the second release were in two parts Meister & Weapon (The Meister Collection contained the first  episodes and The Weapon Collection contained the remaining  episodes) and this release is the Complete series with all  episodes I find it strange that the DVD version of this is $ yet the Blu-Ray version (which is superior to DVD) only cost $! That's an insane price for a complete series box set with all the episodes in BLU-RAY! This is cheaper than any Soul Eater release you will find on Amazon
11.99  this is a fantastic serires however some CDS were scratched and did not play properly you could still watch it just bad quality for the price i dont recomend it just watch it online
11.99  This series is pretty epic and the price for the complete set was even MORE epic I was shocked to get such a great deal and such a quick delivery as well Everything was pristine no damages no scratches Excellent
11.99  soul eater complete seriesis great for the price and the overwhelming quality of the series hard not to watch from start to finish
11.99  awesome anime at a great price there's not much to say aside from this is a great buy watch it with your friends
11.99  Soul Eater is one of those anime series you either love or you hate and more than not you love it If you haven't watched it yet look it up on Netflix This series is a little provocative but most of them are these days The story is intense and the series really sucks you in with some hysterical humor You won't find this for a better price anywhere!
11.99  For me a anime fan to find this series great for a low cost sweet the complete series buy it
11.99  this my show and I love the dvd set at a good price I recommend it for all anime lovers
11.99  The price on this site is basically half of what it costs at places like Best Buy This is a great anime and one of my favorites! Even though it doesn't have a lot of bonus features it has both English subtitles and English dubbed so no matter what your preference is you can still enjoy it
11.99  This boxset is a very good price for the entirity of the series and I love it so much! I have heard many times from friends that they would also like to get their hands on one too and that's just from me telling them about the price and efficiency of delivery
11.99  First of all despite giving the show a five star rating I'm not going to say Soul Eater doesn't have its share of problems (The ending is pretty much a joke as multiple reviewers have stated) And the series is certainly not for everyone But where it's good it really excels This is an anime that I imagine different people linking for different things or disliking for the same qualities that some people are really drawn to Though the first few episodes were fun I wasn't completely sold on the show until around episode  By this time the main characters have been introduced and things take a more dramatic turn than the previous episodesThe mixture of cartoony and silly dark and surreal can be jarring for some but I found this to be a big part of what I personally loved about the show For the most part the balancing act of these different elements was handled quite well  The silly moments often acted as a breather for some of the darkest moments This series could really have you laughing one scene and really break your heart in the nextSometimes the writing could seem a bit weak Sometimes concepts were brought up and ignored or explained and never really explored later in the series Occasionally  I feel this is  even to the story's advantage Episode one for example introduced the two main protagonists and the concept of hunting down  corrupted human souls and  Witch Soul in order to turn a weapon into a death scythe This seemed to set the series up to be a "collect 'em all" formula which I personally find to be boring and I'm glad the series didn't go in that direction In fact I often found myself questioning what would happen next in many points throughout the seriesI won't call it "a masterpiece" or "BEST ANIME EVER" but I found Soul Eater to be very entertaining shonen series When this anime succeeds it's a captivating ride that really left me wanting more but not in a bad way For the differences between the anime and manga this is one series I could imagine a FMA Brotherhood styled remake since the manga is still ongoingThe animation is a really fun ride and it especially shines in the battle scenes And everything especially seems to shine on Blu-Ray As a matter of value this  episode series would be a fantastic price on DVD for under $ but on Blu-Ray it is a must buy for fans of the series
11.99  First of all why buy in Amazon? This goes to about $ elsewhere and this is really the best price I've seen! Buying this is totally worth it It's an amazing show and the characters just grow on you It's one of the shows where you watch it and don't think about your emotional attachment to it until the last few episodes It'll keep you wanting more and you will marathon it possibly more than once
11.99  My daughter asked for this complete series for Christmas and the price was perfect for my budget!  Glad to have found it
11.99  For all the episodes for this price makes this anime completely worth it With such a compelling story line and that darker side of anime it keeps you wanting to watch what happens next
11.99  For the cost this is a very good deal comes with  disc and a few extras In all a must buy for anime fans
11.99  What else could I possibly say  This is a great anime and the price was just a steal  Packaging was nice with beautiful artwork from the anime
11.99  I ordered this  days ago and got it today way way sooner than I expected to In pristine undamaged condition good packaging AMAZING video quality Absolutely no issues so farAs for the series I don't have much to input It's either your thing or not I suggestion swinging by funimation's site or their youtube at one point they had the first four dubbed episodes for free and they still might I'm a huge fan and have watched it a couple of times in entirety already That being said when I saw the price drop I had to snag my own copy! I'm new to blu-ray (just upgraded) but in my opinion it's definitely worth going for the blu-ray especially at this moment when you'd pay the same price for either versionThe set isn't lavish but it's high quality and perfect for someone that is just looking to have the series in their collection (like me) The case is really nice space saving and the case art is beautiful Funimation has definitely sold me &#; Off to snag more blu-ray anime!!
11.99  Considering how expensive anime series can be even on DVD I love that Funimation decided to offer the entire series in a single blu-ray box set instead of solely breaking it up into multiple volumes which individually cost as much as if not more than this single box set of the complete series  As far as the show is concerned I found the characters to be hysterical and goofy for a lot of it while also portraying their completely serious and driven sides at times especially when in battle  This completely bi-polar aspect of the characters personalities is pretty much mirrored in the drastic differences in animation and artistic styles which are great portrayals of the differences in the mood being represented depending on character interactions and settings  Overall I loved the series and I hope they will decide to create a continuation series based on the rest of the manga being released  If all anime shows were made available in single blu-ray box sets like this one it would make buying entire anime series much easier and less expensive
11.99  For the price this was just amazing I had  of my friends purchase this when it became available and we all love itThis series should be a lot more popular than it is in the anime community Keishan's *spelling* evil souls exist in the world and the meister academy created by Death is the only thing that can stop them You have about  or  main characters in this series and you learn to love and hate all of them Maka and Soul are technically the main characters of the story but as a whole in the series you will find other characters to be favoritesI have no complaints about the DVD set Everything was perfect
11.99  I'm willing to get a blu-ray player and then get this So cheap for so many episodes! I love collecting animes and this one's popular Plus my friend would DIE of joy if I bought this :) He'd be dying to come over and watch it XD Plus some animes I need have a second season that is only blu-ray so I need a blu-ray player to get them anyway I know I'll love this anime I just know it :)
11.99  Plot is great! Character development is amazing! And the price for the BD was great so I jumped right on this! Highly recommend this series!
11.99  Everyone been telling me to watch Soul Eater It is really good anime! I haven't watch it yet so glad to get it because it was a great deal for the price because bestbuy was like  something like that and check on amazon it has a better price!
11.99  Had my eye on this one for a while the only problem was the $ price tag but I noticed this morning the price had dropped down to $ Ordered it immediatley A good anime intriguing plot some inuendo this is a bit family friendly sex there is none a scene where a girl is taking a shower a scene where acat-girl? is taking a shower some breast groping a scene where two girls are trapped and it reeks of tentacle rape However in the span of the show there isn't much Also EXCALIBUR!
11.99  Pay close attention on this one bear with me and pay close attention BLU RAY B-L-U R-A-Y complete series  EPISODES = MORE THAN  minutes worth of visual treats for your kindhearted mind and soul FACTORY SEALED SLIP COVER and you complaining? Look man this is as good as it gets go to best buy go to wal mart go to bargain world i dare you i ain't getting this for this price anywhere on the planet unless your neighbor stumbles upon you in its goody  shoes mood mode walking the dog with a fifth of vodka in the system and luckily carrying this item he could most likely say look brother you need this more than me here $ right here right now no other way mate no other way
11.99  This came in the mail earlier then expected and it was a great gift for any anime lover Plus the price is good and the series is enjoyable for most viewers
11.99  This show has something for everyone in it; comedy action and even light fan service; very light but its therealso the show is long and for its current price is a STEAL
11.99  This is by far one of my favorite animes of all times!!! It's got great comedy great character designs and best of all it takes place in the victorian era The price was incredible it was really cheap for all the stuff that come with it looking to buy the next season soon
11.99  The Black Butler Complete !st season collection was a surprise for my  year old  The smile started when the box arrived and continued for hours  Worth the cost at any price
11.99  I was very pleased with the out come of this order Everything was quite exceptional The shipping was fast the packaging was quality and price was even better I am very happy with my purchase and shall give this rating a  out of  stars :)
11.99  Love love love Black Butler! This is a must see and a must have! The price is just right and the box is just lovely!
11.99  Quality is great on this Blu-Ray and the overall box art quality is wonderful Price is a bit high compared to other series priced the same with more features and more premiums should drop price by $ at least
11.99  I was unsure of seeing this series but since the price was good at the time I got the DVD to see it and It was amazing  Now to have the second season price go down
11.99  The series will bring some feelings of deja vu for those who saw the series Hellsing as you have a young aristocratic noble who makes a pact with a demon to solve a tragedy that has befallen him the price being giving his soul to the demon once the bargain has been fulfilled  The animation also feels reminiscent of Hellsing and I'm sure many who have seen the Hellsing series will see a similarity in appearance and demeanor with the characters Sebastian and Alucard as well as Ciel and Lady Hellsing The episodes are enjoyable to watch but obviously not for children with the stories and brutality in them but again that's expected with this series  The set itself is pretty much like with previous Funimation combo sets you have four standard dvds and three blu-rays  that have the entire series on them though the extras really much to really shout about thoughSo if you're a fan of series like HellsingDeath NoteShiki or the like then this is a god one to add to your anime library but if you're turned away from gore dark drama then this is a series you should pass over
11.99  I love this series so I was so happy to get the full series for the cheapest price I could find which was surprising since it is a blu- ray combo pack
11.99  This is one of my favorites the price initially was a bit steep the reason why? Why bluray/dvd combo? If it was bluray alone it would've been at least $ cheaperwhy Funimation?
99.0  I like having ambient scenes on my tv when I'm listening to music and cleaning so I was interested by the idea of some international people watching  The video was only the  minute Bhimsen Temple; Bhaktapur scene  That was cool and I really wish I could have seen the other scenes promised  Not worth the price for less than  minutes though
29.95  How many more lives could be saved and the quality of their lives be increased without unnecessary drugs and/or surgeries  The truth of the matter is that America has become dependent on sickness care that is expensive and does not work  Here we have it a country that has become obese  lazy  and hooked on prescription drugs  The pharmaceutical cartel or big pharma is intent on ruining any and all to make mega wealthGreat job on this documentary as America needs to be told the absolute truth and start working towards the causes of disease and not just deaden their brain and senses  Wellness will eventually win out when sickness care becomes way to costly but at what price to humanity !
14.88  This show is definitely geared towards fans of Jeff Lynne and ELO But even for those who are not die-hard fanclub members there sre some great unplugged-type performances I'm not convinced that average or casual fans would get their money's worth though and the cost of entry here is too high for all but the most dedicated fans It's a shame because this docu-vid would make a great advertisement to sell the CDs/MPs But who wants to pay top price to watch an hour-long advertisement -- other than fans (like myself) who will buy anything Jeff-related?  To Jeff's management: give this show away for free on Amazon and Netflix! Use it to draw interest to Jeff's new and old releases
9.03  Love this show and all other Anthony Bourdain Shows as well Shame on Amazon with me being a paid Prime customer to be notified of the price increase and go and turn on my prime watchlist to find that none of my shows are Prime eligible anymore!!! Just a little over a week later! Nowwhy am I going to pay more to pay again? NOT GOOD AMAZON! NOT GOOD AT ALL OF YOUso if you are willing to pay twice this show is definitely well worth it
9.03  I greatly enjoy watching Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations series Though I do not get to travel internationally I am allowed to live vicariously through his adventures learning more about different cultures through their food while drooling over (most) of what Tony gets to go eat The show strikes a good balance between exploring the food and talking about the culture in which the food evolved Tony's generally an entertaining narrator and sometimes runs with some interesting personalities in the location he's visitingThe only negative aspect of the show is that watching it frequently makes me hungry and sad that I am not capable of cooking the food I am seeing It also makes me want to buy expensive copper or earthenware cooking containers and go build a wood-fired stove in the backyard
9.07  Cute stories my grandchildren love to watch Good family values and good manners are taught The price is very reasonable
17.81  I'm a huge DC/marvel fan I greatly enjoy most of the animated shows that have been showcase on Cartoon Network and Disney XD  I unfortunately can not recommend this show at this time Beware of the  Batman is a cheap Star Wars :clone wars ripoff and should be consider a failed experiment
17.81  I've watched the first two episodes of the show so far and I'm not sure what to think of it There are parts I like and parts I immediately reject I like that they're not just recycling the same rouge's gallery as every other Batman series and they're digging into some of the lesser-known villians and making them interesting I don't like the changes to Alfred however Turning him into an ex-MI agent (who miraculously can't hear an antique car pulling up directly in front of him)seems like a cheap gimmick to reinvent the character As a result he seems more like Jason Statham than Alfred Pennyworth He was fine the way he was and I think the change was entirely unnecessaryBesides that the Batman himself seems like a good iteration of the character but there is one part in the second episode that stands out to me He's talking with the woman who will become Katana and out of the blue starts profiling her out loud for her to hear Now if Batman was doing this to someone I say "cool he's flexing his dectective muscles in a cool way" But it isn't BATMAN doing the profiling it's Bruce Wayne That's a problem While Batman is portrayed in an intelligent capable yet still human way Bruce is portrayed in the WRONG way If he goes around showing everyone how smart he is and what a good detective he is it destroys the illusion of playboy millionaire and people can connect him to the bat that much more easilyI know that seems like something small but it says a lot about how they're trying to characterize Bruce this time and it's not a wise choice at least in my opinion
17.81  While I cannot recall how I learned about BtB as it was coming to an end of its st season; when I knew it existed I decided to purchase this first episode Ladies & gentlemen maybe my experience was like that of an addict 'CAUSE I WAS HOOKED!!!!! I had no particular expectation of what BtB would offer and while his rogue gallery of criminals are some I have never heard of in this instance it truly works well Having no pre-conceived notion of the villains eg The Joker Clayface Two-Face the usual suspects made this modern version of Bruce Wayne/Batman so much more intriguing And although Alfred is perhaps a tad bit bigger than Bruce/The Bat it really makes this so very appealing and it is not a distraction I did not want to pay the price Amazon was asking for the digital episodes without having the physical copy of it so I waited and waited until BtB was released and bought it YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED It ends with such a cliffhanger that I truly hope it returns to answer those questions posed in the end Get it; you will definitely enjoy this
28.0  We discovered and fell in love with Fireman Sam when our children were born while we were living in Wales My children were then thrilled to find a wealth of Fireman Sam on Amazon and Netflix when we moved back to the US and the show was a staple of the bedtime routine That was however until this version appeared The new &#;Americanized&#; voices have ruined an otherwise great children's show I have searched the HIT website and hammered away at Google for some explanation as to why the show was redubbed but have been unable to find an explanation If the original voice cast was no longer available that would be one thing but someone made an active decision to incur the cost of redubbing previously completed and available episodes with new voice actors and a different accent for no apparent reason Fireman Sam was created to take place in Wales where the inhabitants speak English with a Welsh accent It's not a show without a set geographic location so changing the accent seems to undermine part of the show Unless or until HIT decides to return the accents to the original we will be sticking with our current DVD versions and not investing in the show any further
28.0  My family loved the pilot episode of this show  The characters are all easy to understand and have nice voices (eg aren't constantly yelling like Dora & Diego)  We really liked the tie in with art projects kids can actually do with a few cheap supplies  My wife and I also liked that some deeper concepts were tied inWe look forward to more episodes!
4.49  With that said it gets old really really fast The price is a bit spendy but considering how much kids like it it is worth it
18.0  Unlike the DVD-R version these discs are actual DVDs! Apparently the Canadian market gets this fancy steel case with the real thing and not cheap burn jobs Unfortunately there are no extra features in it just the  episodes
18.0  For creative thinkers and doers - not afraid to examine life and live their dreams here and now  If someone had just told me about this place I would not have believed them Seeing this movie will blow your mind wide open The answer to How Can My Life Get Even Better Thank It Already Is?  Not for fearful people who don't like change I wonder how much it would cost to go visit there and check it out?
13.07  great show! Love Naruto and everything it brings to the table Love the characters and the plot line to this series Great price as well
14.32  This movie was all that I have heard it was As a  stepper myself I really was stirred by the cost to Bill W and Dr Bob to found AA
14.32  While this is an engaging account of the story of the unique program of Alcoholics Anonymous it is also a compelling depiction of the weight of leadership Bill Wilson put everything into AA and it wasn't enough for some himself included at times This weighed heavily on him but he stayed the course Imperfectly to be sure but he remained on task This is leadership And it's leadership in a movement that purports to not have leaders that govern but only serve - part of the uniqueness of AA and one of the reasons it has remained so influential while other recovery programs have faltered This movie helps us see the personal cost to Bill to build and protect such a movement The movie should help counter the tendency of some to deify the man as it accurately portrays his humanness It does a great job in covering a lot of ground while also staying focused on the life of this important figure It is essential viewing for folks in AA and certainly worthwhile for anyone interested in history and leadership Well done
11.97  We love signing time and the animal videos (farm and zoo) are my kid's favorites for sure!  Great price on rental too!
8.06  Four stars for the show  star for amazonBought the Season and episodes  were not included  But can be purchased separately  So if you want the entire season it will cost just under $Amazons failure to be transparent aside I enjoyed the show
8.04  I love watching old steam trains and this video had tons of them Beautiful scenery and great areas to film you will love watching this film Thank you Amazon for providing these They usually cost around - dollars to buy but with prime you can watch them for free Excellent deal
8.09  funny corny you will be laughing hard after watching video/streaming program this is a  episode disc/streaming show BUY NOW good price and value
49.96  Good movie that shows the amount of work that goes into video game creation And it this price it's hard to pass up
49.96  This  is a terrific behind-the-scenes look at many different aspects of making the game It includes interviews with actors musicians programmers and producers Excellent viewing for any fan of the game And you can't complain about the price (free)
32.99  My mth old loves this video he will watch the entire show Great price fast download plays quickly with no b pausing
32.99  The price says $ with amazon prime but when I go to watch it is says you have to buy it  Very confusing!!!  My  y/o does not understand why we cannot watch it!
32.99  Bubble Guppies are a favorite in our housegreat price to upload videos and great quality I will say that my daughters enjoy watching them on long trips
32.99  We compared buying bubble guppies on amazon to dvd For the price you got usually about  more episodes for $ less by purchasing on amazon It has all the episodes my kids love and can sing with
32.99  My  y/o daughter couldn't live without Fresh Beats since they took them off Netflix  They were on Amazon for a reasonable price so now she has them again  Good little bit of education on the show and gave her a great start for a love of music watching this has made every toy she has an instrument of some kind and she loves her toy drums and guitar more than ever
32.99  My daughter love the video soooooo much She can't stop watching it And it is worth it for the price -  DVDs in one Can't complain
32.99  Love little bear as an adult it is a peaceful teaching childrens show The children love it it's a claming and teaches kindness and loving family values along with other skills preschoolers need This show was a big motivation for me to sign up for amazon prime We had cable in the past and I hesitated to cut the cable because of this show and how much the children loved it I had a smart tv and netflex but it was amazon prime that allowed us to finally cut the cable and high prices because Amazon provided this season  and all the other seasons of Little Bear With the combination of netflex and amazon prime and an desktop antenna we are totally happy for about a sixth of the price plus the savings on amazon prime shipping will pay for the cost of it in a year the best tv deal available
5.95  I usually don't like documentaries for various reasons but this one really drew me in  Now it could be because I am a programmer and watching the transition of technologies is a hobby of mine  I love when "Barriers of entry" to anything is removed Like people where weren't able to vote suddenly get to  This has the potential to have the same affect  It is not mentioned in the film but women minorities hell even disconnected poor white guys could never imagine putting together a movie to express a story before but with the lowering of the cost of making a movie more people can make one  Now quiet a few people made the point there will be more bad movies my opinion is that young directors will be able to get more practice earlier in life and will be better for it and I can't wait!I need to explain the "vote" comment  When you watch a movie how often does it reflect your life or anyones you know?  Does anyone outside of hollywood really know people like the ones we watch on film?  Do most of the women you know look like the women in movies?  Men have you ever had a boss offer you a drink in the office before  noon?  Waiters and waitress in NYC are you apartments as large as they are in the movies?  Does anyone really know a minority that has the inappropriate/appropriate curse word on his lips for every situation?  Probably not but were a shown these things time and time again like they are normal hopefully this digital film revolution will put cameras in the hands of more directors that can make a story that will work without all the gimmicks currently favored by Hollywood
5.95  You get four minutes of Robert Rodriguez talking about making &#;Grindhouse&#; which is not much But hey it doesn't cost anything so why not?
32.95  This was THE show to build the Tron franchise None of the movies past present or future could possibly create the depth of canon that this show began to do The series was almost identical to the  Tron Legacy movie storyline and followed it exactly except for one brief but important change To keep from ruining it for you I'll just say that the &#;difference&#; is covered nicely in the last episodesOne of the things about this series that is surprising is the incredibly high production quality Every episode is blu-ray quality with movie level effects animation acting visuals and sound There are top names in the voice acting like Elijah Wood and Bruce Boxleitner (among others) After watching a few episodes it will be clear to you that producing this must have cost Disney a fortuneThat's where the heartache comes in The show had good ratings on Disney's main network so they moved it to their pay-subscription XD network which was dying to help save the channel The XD channel has ultimately been a failure and naturally Tron Uprising lost ratings when it was switched from a free channel to a pay channel Disney then cancelled the show citing &#;low ratings&#;It amazes me that Disney who is now the franchise king has such short sightedness that they couldn't see (or didn't care) how this series could have turned Tron from a cult following into a mainstream IP on par with something like Transformers Disney literally shot itself in the wallet by cancelling the showYou see unlike the movies there was time for the series to develop both backstory and individual characters with a depth not possible in any movie Tron fans get to visit the history of the grid see current events and future happenings in great detail We get a look at the rich tapestry of life in the grid outside of what the movies could show us We find out that Flynn and his son are not the only heroes with stories to be told and that there is &#;life&#; in the grid worth fighting and dying forAs a software developer myself and fan of the Tron concept the anthropomorphistic storytelling is absolutely incredible It's hard to ever view &#;programs&#; the same way again While the movies hint at this the series dives into the deep end of program purpose feeling choices and destinyAdd to that the deep social commentary on revolution and oppression and thinking adults find themselves mesmerized Children will enjoy the show but only adults will truly understand the deeper nuances It's the kind of really rare media that a parent can not only watch with their kids to the mutual enjoyment of both but also have meaningful conversations about afterwards As a result I often found myself discussing real life issues through the context of the show that I hadn't expected to be talking about for years to comeLike all cancelled series I hold out no hope that it will be brought back At this point all we can do it is enjoy what was made and try to draw attention to this crown jewel in the Tron franchise crown
32.95  My seven year old son and I have been watching this together  It started out simple and thoroughly enjoyable  There is an open embrace of big questions which are thankfully handled without abusing the audience  And it absolutely helps that this is visually stunning with a great sound trackTo my joy as the episodes progressed it has gotten increasingly complex and thoughtful yet not specifically "dark"  It is a fantastic intellectual exercise on how to be a leader who now has doubt and yet has a responsibility to those who are beginning to hope for what is turning out to be an increasingly uncertain future and who personally struggles with the extended cost to everyone and a now mixed assessment of what constitutes actual freedom  It is an intersection of ideology and passion and a surrounding world that is often indifferent sometimes bothered and yet eternally changed and hopeful as a result of it  All of that with tons of action a sense of mortality and without blood or lower forms of violence  This serves the story very well and keeps it all very existential and clean enough for my family  Think of it as a Matrix for kids in that senseAt about episode  The Stranger the writing seems to take a leap forward along with an apparent boost in the already fantastic animation  Our hero is changing and we are not sure how and he is not sure that it is for the betterPhenomenal  After each episode my son has to disappear to the play room for an hour or so to work it all out complete with an excess of sound effects  My daughter who is four doesn't quite grasp it all and it is sometimes a bit intense for her but she sticks with it  She observed to me after watching episode  that "Mara is strong  Strong like Beck  And I am strong too"  Which makes me very proudThis series is highly recommended for grown-ups and their kids alike  If you want to ask big questions and to see a big story in a "theater" that is equal to the trust you must place in such things then I think you've found the right placeAnd finally after watching this we went back and watched Tron Legacy and it seemed clearer and more meaningful  So definitely take opportunity to re-watch that cult classic that it has become  The expanding Tron universe has come to occupy the imagination and motion of our small family and I can tell you that our kids are ostensibly better for it and me too in a way; which is not something you often say about a cartoon  Nice work Disney
32.95  While this show is aimed towards a teen audience I found that I greatly enjoy everything it has to offer I am a huge Tron fan - so seeing all the artwork and design that went into the show was almost worth the entry price alone but I was pleasantly surprised that the story struck me as interesting too  If you've ever had an interest in seeing more of what happens in Flynn's arcade this is a great series to watch
3.74  I've read a biography of Tyndale and I liked how they chose to tell the story in this  minute movie Kept to the point and simple for kids quoted lots of Scripture didn't shy away from the hardness of reality (Tyndale was burned a the stake at the end of the movie) however was done thoughtfully so as not to unnecessarily scare kids but to make the point about the possible cost of following Jesus and to show how Tyndale's dying prayer that God would change the king of England was answered a couple years later This is the first of the Torchlighters series we've watched and we will definitely watch others
3.78  Built in  the SantaFe  goes on a cross country trip from Los Angeles to Chicago and back Totally rebuilt at a cost of  million dollars the engine ran flawlessly the entire  mile trip and back for a total of  miles over an  day period with stops along the way The engine to this day still makes trips carrying passengers and other what nots along the way If you love trains you'll really enjoy this video A nice blast from the past enjoyed every minute of it
14.82  Saw the show at Adultswim and told myself that I needed to re-watch the entire show just to see what I missed the price is worth it
14.82  When i watched this live on TV i was not expecting a musical per se  However might I say that the Toki - Skwisgarr guitar dual and the parts that led up to it are worth more than the price of this buying this video  Also George Corpsegrinder Fisher was phenomenal especially in the last ten minutes  Buy this video  It is an amazing piece of heavy metal loving parody
21.29  Sylvester McCoy's characterization of the Doctor is very interesting and "Ghost Light" has some good ideas The bottom-of-the-barrel production values sink it though Not only are the sets cheap and ugly and the makeup risible but the story itself is far too compressed If it had been extended another episode and given room to breathe instead of going from one dialogue scene to the next it might have been really good instead of almost incoherent The incidental music is egregious as well While the BBC's neglect likely brought the show to this point on the basis of this episode it looks like many of those involved with it had given up as well
21.29  Thanks for giving us Whovians another avenue for watching these classic episodes! Not to mention its only a fraction of the price compared to buying the seasons on DVD!
21.29  Tom Baker is my favorite Doctor I enjoy any story that includes not only Sarah Jane Smith (played by the wonderful Liz Sladen) but also Lt Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter who also wrote the novella for the story) The way they interact through the story is fun to watch Harry is Watson to the Doctor's Holmes You get to see the differences between his two companions One has been travelling through space and time with him since his Third incarnation and the other is relatively new to the TARDIS It makes for some very funny momentsIf you love the classic Dr Who stories as much as I do you overlook the cheap sets/costumes/special effects knowing that just comes with the program I can't say that I was ever scared of the green bubblewrap monster but I enjoyed the story immensely Watching it again as an adult brought back all of the fun I had watching it originally + years ago Thank you so much!
4.48  My son loves thisincredible cartoonhe watches it all the time no complaints at all!  The price is not bad at all
4.48  I thought the price was expensive for a short movie but I loved it  It is a great little movie
4.48  This was the right price and the right fun level for my Grandson to watch Thanks to Disney I loved it
23.68  Five stars for Alton but ZERO for Amazon/ Where the heck is episode  Right On Q with all of the wonderful barbecuing and the how to for making your own backyard smoker? I came looking for that specific one and for no reason imaginable you've decided not to include it? I'm not paying full price for an entire season when it isnt the whole season and I'm getting ripped for the one episode I want the most
34.17  I'm not a professional reviewer and have regretfully not done my part in reviewing things I have purchased on Amazon However this movie is very much loved by my grandchildren I am  years old and remember watching these 'backinnaday!' It is so nice that the message is still one that can be applied today The overall message is of forgiveness protecting the planet and the power to change Goodness prevails in the end and there is no horrible retribution for transgressions Even the bad guys are surprised by being forgiven by the kids they were harassing I'll always pull for the power of good over evil and the innate propensity for humankind to opt for good This movie is one of hope and warning I know this sounds sappy but what can I do? The show gets sappy sometimes! It's cheesy old-school special effects but I think that for the time the movie was made they really tried to make it quality and cutting edge I wish it didn't cost $ but it'll be worth it if my grandkids understand the underlying message Go Mothra! (so glad they kept the original Mothra song the twins sing!)
11.48  While the factual history is accurate and an array of photographs of rare and superb firearms are used to great effect that is about all I can recommend about this series after watching the first two episodes  The scripting is lethargic and boring no imagery is used to illustrate the concepts being presented and there are frequent lapses into long boring monologues by experts who act solely as talking heads  Anyone who has watched documentaries on the History or Discovery Channels knows was good production values are  And this ain't them  In essence this is done in a very amateurish way much like someone doing their own home videos  The history of the gun is fascinating and woven into almost every important event in the past  This plays like that boring American history teacher you had in high school who droned on endlessly expelling all of the color and life out of history  This was clearly done on a low budget so I guess I can't be too harsh  The only reason I am not insisting on my money back from Amazon is that it only cost $ for the series  I figure I will get bored enough at some point that even this will provide some entertainment
12.67  Based on a specific scene this footage appears to be from  or  It seems to have been taken by a single person who wrote off his Hawaii trip for tax purposes He doesn't get any privilege access to sites so we always have views of crowds The music is cheap electronic music and the script is not read well (dry and dull) Watched for free hope I can find better free videos Don't pay for this
12.65  The acting is decent The humor is quirky and mildly amusing The language was so offensive I had to stop watching Too bad There was some potential there if it hadn't gone for the cheap vulgarity
12.63  It is fun to see this pilot which never aired AFTER you have seen the more expensive version that made it to TV  It is just as interesting but the sets are more bare-bone and they don't have the Mycroft sequence  I think the storyline is better and more realistic in this original pilot  The remake seems to have not only enhanced the visuals dramatically (which is delicious eye candy) but also tampered with the story of the serial killer; it seems they thought it needed to be enhanced but I feel the story was better in it's original state but certainly approve of the Mycroft sequence addition  Enjoy!
22.63  I watched it to get ideas to prepare for Storms or other disasters I am not a millionare so the stories on these huge expensive bunkers does not interest me I also felt that the first season not only focused more on middle class and lower income people but the first season showed more &#;normal&#; people Starting to sense the show is trying to build the dramactics rather than document people of this lifestyle Personally after watching the first season it caused me to be better prepared for the blizzards we get in the northern midwest I have a few weeks worth of food in case we are snowed in This is enough for my family and some neighbors who might not be as prepared
13.49  The sound quality is poor to average and it looks like it was shot on someone's camera phone but the price of admission is worth it For those of us who can't afford the $ a day to train with Robby this is the best you're going to get I've learned so many new exercises and ways to use dumbbells that I never knew existed and now I can go into the gym and not wait for someone to get off of a machine and I'm getting fantastic results with less weight which has greatly reduced my risk for injury Even though I'm not considered large -- at only  lbs -- since implementing a few of these new and unique exercises I've been able to build a very balanced and &#;classic&#; physique which actually makes me appear to be larger than I really am Robby explains the importance of the &#;upper back arch&#; and how to arrange your exercises in a way that makes sense for you He also stresses the importance of a healthy diet for long-term success My advice would be to try to ignore the production quality and take this for what it is a lesson from a living master for only $
35.79  The PROS:  The stories delve into mathmatics- numbers shapes and patterns and my three-year-old actually repeats and seems to learn  There are not any other math shows he enjoys as muchThe CONS:  The price seemed a little high for the entire season but buying the entire season is cheaper than buying one episode at a time
35.79  We were so happy to see it available and included at no extra cost with Amazon Prime Great show for toddlers & preschoolers!
35.79  My per-schooler loves Umizoomi!  I like that the show focuses on problem solving helping people out and learning  The price for buying a season is very affordable as well  We do not have cable in our house so it is nice having a short commercial free show that my son can watch while I prepare dinner
35.79  My  year old LOVES "Team Umizoomi" He had been begging to see the one called "Shark Car" but I deleted it off of our DVR My poor little guy was sick so I had to find it I found it quickly on my Kindle Fire and downloaded it for him The price was reasonable My son loved having the video and I like that he can watch it over and over again No problems with downloading or sound
35.79  Your little ones will love these umizoomi videos and you'll love the price! They are made just to watch on your PC so don't plan on burning them to a DVD or anything (they have great dvd's if you want to buy those separately) We bought this episode when we were in a bedtime crunch and my little one was restless She was asleep mid way through the nd time around  She has learned so much from Team Umizoomi They are very educational and I have to admit I actually enjoy them too MIGHTY MATH POWER!!!
35.79  I viewed this because my  yr old granddaughter was driving her Nana insane and I was given the ultimatum to find something for her to watch or take her out to my man cave and baby sit her Not being crazy I looked on the Amazon Prime kids section and she immediately began saying unizoomi so I viewed it for free as a Prime member My granddaughter sat down on the couch next to me and never made another sound for the entire time Team Umizoomi was playing That was worth the price of a year of Prime membership right there Cant say enough about the kids section of the video portion of prime membership Keeps the young toddlers transfixed on the boob tube so other members of the household can function Great baby sitter! And cheap too!
13.44  I don't like Max and Ruby they drive me crazy (well Ruby does Max is benign enough) But my  year old loves them and we put this on her kindle and it has totally proven worth the  bucks it cost to get the first two seasons You can download them or stream them so she streams at home and we have a few episodes downloaded for long car rides There are  shorts per episode so there are dozens and dozens of stories in this one product
13.41  enjoyed it good fighting its a diverse group of guys I was surprised to see a contender from Guam where im from even though he lost UD had some good fights in it made me want to watch more if the episodes weren't so expensive they should sell the whole season in one package that cost lower than buying the individual episodes
22.26  My granddaughter is  years old and loves Diego  She is happy so grandma is too  The price was right for the amount of entertainment it supplies
12.7  great show  shocking funny  and real human emotions really makes you think  about the price you pay for the lifestyle you live they live it well
9.34  So I've watched the first two episodes of this season and I like what I see thus far I've changed my rating of the season to reflect that I'll make a in-depth review at the end of the season Below is my original thoughts due to the delay in the release of the seasonThis is going to be a little bit of a rant so if you don't feel like reading a rant about Viacom I'm sorrySo as others have said this season of Korra is not being uploaded to any digital distribution site for legal streaming/download I find that to be VERY annoying I haven't had a traditional television in over  years I watched Avatar: the Last Airbender here on Amazon So when the new series the Legend of Korra came on here I was very excited and started watching it here as well Same for season  Now I can't watch it here (and thus can't pay for it) and while I won't be pirating the series I can understand why somebody wouldThe reasons I have seen given for this choice on the part of Viacom are that there was a fair amount of piracy outside of the USA and that the digital services lowered the ratings (as in the view count) on the Nickelodeon channelI don't think those are good enough reasons to cut out a not insignificant part of your viewer base Last season had nearly  reviews now I'd say maybe one out of every five hundred wrote a review for the show If that's the case then that's $ in viewers (at $ per episode) for the  episode season I don't see why anyone would want to cut out that much money (even if the show DOES cost way more to make than that)I don't want to give a bad review to this season (thus  stars) just because of a decision of a boardroom in a office somewhere But I feel I need to make my voice heard so that there is a data point for that boardroom to think about for next time
9.35  Very nice we enjoyed it  good pic quality would order more in the future due to value and price for money
5.49  This film is a wonderful reminder of of God's sovereignty in events of history and of the immense cost in terms of having our own Bible in English The detail and accuracy of the film makes it a treasure to keep and watch more than once The acting is very very good and the film can have a deep impact on those who have a desire to grow in faith and zeal for the Saviour
17.85  William Shakespeare's tragedy of love twisted love and deceit and treachery has been presented many times and from many angles Thus the real task of a reviewer is to decide whether the presentation holds up to the bard's intention This BBC production overall does so but with a couple of complains from this quarter Anthony Hopkins plays Othello here His reading of the role is to make Othello something of a frantic and hysterical lover and husband These qualities make it hard to believe that given this characterization that Othello would be chosen to lead the military defense of Venice and its commerical interestsGreat warriors in any case do not necessarily have to be prudent lovers or prudent anything else for that matter Although it is easy to see how this Othello will come to a bad end it is hard to see that as tragic on this reading As for the other important role Iago played here by Bob Hoskins it is hard to see that even a jealousy and susceptible Othello could take his offerings on faith There is just a little too much of the modern gangster here (a genre that Hoskins excels at) for my tastes My read on Iago calls for more cunning and much more guile Desdemonda is mainly window dressing here although it is not hard to see that she would for Othello However as always with a full presentation of Shakespeare ( hours  minutes) savor the language That is worth the price of admission
6.0  I had high hopes for this show about gay farmers I thought that finally the world would have the chance to see that all gays are not the drama queens portrayed on TV; I was wrong! The first couple of shows started out ok but soon the show turned from farming to well ummm drama Instead of the show focusing on farming and all things involved with farming which is what I had hoped the show would be about the subject of each show turned out to be about Brent being a rip roaring little b**t*h to Josh and them hocking their products like a cheap QVC program Not only did the show have very little to do with farming but it also had very little to do with love and respect for each other Brent comes across as a Martha Stewart wannabe The difference between Martha and Brent is Martha has some class while Brent has zero class It seems that Brent's only true interest in fame I am baffled as to why Josh would stay in a relationship where he is treated so poorly I guess despite being an author and having a career in the advertising field that even a guy who should want more from a partner will settle for less than he deserves Love is blind! The show really should not have been promoted as two gay city boys leaving the city for a life in the country as farmers Neither of them seems to do a lick of work as far as farming goes; they seem completely clueless as to what farming really is My partner and I are real farmers and we're way too busy to fight constantly and backstab the way Brent and Josh appear to do We don't have the luxury of having a person like Farmer John doing the manual work for us we do it all by ourselves! My partner and I are real gay farmers; we know the feeling of aching bones blistered hands torn up knuckles and sleepless nights We know what it's like to work in the blazing sun and tend to animals in blizzards and pouring rain We know what it's like to fail and succeed at farming We know what it is like to be in the barn on freezing nights helping a lamb or baby goat be born We don't make a living hocking our products on a TV show that is promoted as a farming show we make our living by actually working our fingers to the bone and being diversified in what we do on the farm to keep income coming in so that we can live our dream of being farmers I read that this show is moving to the Cooking Channel That leaves me wondering if the Cooking Channel people have so much as a clue what they're doing??????? The only people interested in The Fabulous Beekman Boys would be people who like low class drama Sorry but this show is not geared towards real farmers people in love or gay couples This show is geared towards the people who would be just as happy watching Jersey Shore Bridezilla or any other low class reality show If you want to know about real farming the work involved with real farming and couples working together in a loving relationship while doing real farming than watch RFD-TV If you want to watch a couple treat each other with little respect appear to do nothing that doesn't involve drama and is not really farm related than watch reruns of Married With Children Also these two salesmen are great at selling but I guess that's pretty easy when you're mostly female fans and small group of male fans are gullible I won't be watching their show when it moves to The Cooking Channel I will be watching RFD-TV where the farmers are real and the people treat each other with respect!
2.24  This is a wonderful animated series You will find yourself watching it over and over The $ price for the complete series is very nice as well (Amazon Instant Video) Buying each episode separate on DVD would cost you around $-$ each & for all  you are looking at $-$ (And that is not including shipping and handling) With celebrity voice talents this is a must have animated series to ownIn Conclusion: The Greatest Adventure Stories From The Bible educates and informs children between the ages of - by teaching them positive values such as trust faith courage and cooperation which are learned through animated adventures from biblical stories Definitely worth the $
14.79  Yeah it's nostalgic and brings back a lot of childhood memories for me  In fact this show was one of the main reasons why I skipped school so much  However after watching a couple of episodes of this show as an adult I would have to say VR Troopers didn't stand the test of time  I still have a couple of VHS episodes and the action figures laying around somewhere but I can't say that I will make the investment to purchase this item  Don't get me wrong the price is good for the whole season but this is not  years ago  As an adult I find the show to be corny silly badly scripted and cheaply produced  However it was good for the time that it came out  As a kid I found the show to be great funny interesting and impressive  Also found it to be better and more intense than its big brother Mighty Morphin' Power RangersThere's nothing like the Skugs who starts off as normal looking people who smart-mouth others for questioning them before transforming into combative foot soldiers  I can't really picture grown adults buying this show to view for themselves  However I do think that kids would still appreciate it even if they see it as "old" or whatever  If I had kids I would definitely get it for them to watch and I'd probably watch a few episodes with them  About  episode would probably be all that I could tolerate now  Maybe they should run it on TV around after school hours to see how today's kids would like it  I'm not knocking the show because it was definitely one of my favorites of the s but time progresses quickly  If this was - or shortly after this would be a  star product without question but it's   I support the idea of releasing this series but I will not support it by investing in it  Once more didn't stand the test of time
24.56  My  yr old who just doesn't want to talk saw very immediate success with this video We rented it on Amazon Instant and the first time we watched it he was laughing at the silly faces and noises but by the end of the video he did the sign for &#;more&#; which made me so happy I cried We put it on again (since we have unlimited watching for  days) and the second time through he said &#;ball&#; and &#;go&#; and &#;pop pop pop&#; all of this from a very decidedly non-verbal child Very immediate success I love that it is not cartoons but that it is real people and toys and they are emulating how a speech therapy session would go It feels like getting professional help without the price tag or even the stigma
28.63  "The Sacrament" or the "The Last Sacrament" (depending on what name you heard it promoted by) is a decently paced and plotted revisit of the Jonestown massacre of the late 's The Ti West directed Eli Roth produced film brings with it some powerful scenes and action despite being completely predictable in its outcome For those of us old enough to remember Jonestown first hand and for those of us in the Bay Area like myself where the overwhelming number of the victims of the People Temple lived the film brings some chills And actually the film softens the blow a little compared the real life horrors of the cult's demiseGene Jones' (strange irony) performance is electric making the rest of the performers pale in comparison If the whole film was as good as Jones this would have been a  / or  star effort As it is it's a reach to spend $ for this but if and when the price drops it's worth a watch
8.46  I purchased  Go Diego Go single episode for my  year old son to watch on Kindle Fire He likes Diego's little Jaguar so this is a great story to watch The video runs well on Kindle Fire and the price for single episode is good No complain
8.48  I have been looking forward to this movie for months and I'm only disappointed by the price and the length For $ I get to hang out with Richard Dawkins and Lawrence Krause for an hour which I can repeat as long as Amazon makes it available Good thing I'm a fan but you don't have to be to enjoy the movie If you're genuinely curious about atheists this offers a variety of nice people who simply explain their unbelief
5.36  Is one of my granddaughters favorite she can spend hours watching the show When I saw it was available I was glad price is good too  per episode
15.13  You can't go wrong with Rick Steve's brand of travel dvds and booksHowever I wished that in this program he could have showed more places to hang out  He could have also provided more information on how to get to the sites and method of travel to get to the locations since many of the locations are not in walking distance  And he could have given more travel tips on how much a taxi ride should cost so that travelers don't get price gouge (a very common problem with tourists) train ticket price point bus ride price point etc And more information on recommended hotels to stay at  And more recommended great eats restaurants cafes etc and price points for the hotels and restaurants  And business hours of the museums historical sites etc  He does cover very little about the restaurants he ate at and taxi and bus pass but he could have showed MORE information not just a few seconds brief mentioned  Because I feel that have good places to eat clean places to stay and easy modes of transportation will make or break your trip and your budgetAnd although I like the history lessons that he gives on the different places he should squeeze in more of the traveling tips that I have mentioned above  I felt like Rick took too much time in the program to talk about the history of the places and ran out of time to give more travel tips (as stated above)  And maybe he should make the program longer to cover more information  Each program is shortHe should organize the program in the traveler's shoes  Meaning he should start off the program with arriving at the airport to how to get a taxi ride (without getting price gouge) get to the hotel plan his route map for the trip with sites and restaurants where he went to first where he ate breakfast lunch dinner etc  What he did on day     ectNo other travel shows do this but I hope that someone from Rick Steve's team will read this review and make the next travel program like thisI am travelling to Europe in a few weeks so I watched this to get an idea of what to do and how to get around where to eat sleep etc  and I didn't find his show very helpful for this purpose  It is still entertaining but could have been more helpful with more practical tipsI also own his travelling companion books for the different cities and countries that I will be traveling to  His books have more information but I don't have time to go through hundreds of pages from his books from cover to cover  So I was hoping that watching his program could be a shortcut but it wasn't much helpI recommend getting the "Lonely Planet" Series of travel books if you are planning to travel because they are more helpful than Rick's books  The Lonely Planet books have more details of eateries places to visit hotels price points maps trip planned  Very similar to Rick's books except Lonely Planet is more straight to the point and is more organized in my opinion  So it makes it easy to get to the information that you need to really quickHope this will help you get prepared for a great trip!
5.39  Like a large portion of Shakespeare film viewers I needed help for school  I was pulled into the story nicely by this version  The performances of the actors playing Rosalind and Jacques are especially great  The wresting match was pretty clunky but I expected that from the budget and that stuff is secondary to the language and the acting  In a way the less expensive production helped separate the experience from the gloss of movies in general It seemed to bring the language to the front Although I love the big lush Branagh(sp?) productions I hope to find other smaller productions like this one for my other classroom assignments
5.39  If like me you're into the whole Shakespeare thing then this romantic comedy is well worth experiencingInspired by the prose piece Rosalynde by Thomas Lodge the pastoral poetry of Christopher Marlowe The Passionate Shepherd and the romantic poetry of Edmund Spenser who would stick his poems on treeshere then a very endearing period piece that captures the spirit of the play very well  The name Ganimede appears in Marlowe's poem Hero and Leander as is the title line above quoted in this playHelen Mirren does an absolutely excellent job playing Rosalinde /Ganimede whose father becomes disinherited from his estate by his brother the Duke  She is allowed to remain because she was raised from birth with her female cousinWhen Rosalinde gets banished too she and her cousin both head for the Forest of Arden located near Stratford and for safety she changes identity  assuming the guise of a man  Meanwhile her would be suitor heartbroken heads to the same forest and pines and writes poetry which he sticks on trees  When he meets her in her disguise he does not recognise her/him despite the common resemblance to Helen Mirren  Several alternate romantic themes are developed with different with different characters simultaneouslyThe language reaches the very height of invention we have come to expect from ShakespeareHer would be lover's life is in jeopardy from another parallel storyI have enjoyed this and watched it several times  Now if you have Amazon Prime  as I write you can watch this for free as you can watch many Shakespeare movies Some of theBBC Shakespeare Tragedies DVD Giftboxcannot be bought separately and can be quite expensive to get the whole collection but again as I write you can Derek Jacobi'sBBC Shakespeare: Hamletfor free on PrimeIf you like this I highly recommend Zeffirelli'sRomeo and Juliet and you can watch it on Amazon video Olivia Hussey  at the time gives a simply awesome performance as Juliet and the movie conveys the wonderful passion of these star crossedI think you will enjoy this and I hope this was helpful
5.39  To briefly answer the reviewer who had trouble with the sound I didn't have any  But I have had that trouble with other feeds that reviewers did not report so I wonder what is the causeI liked this production very much  You may recognize the actress who plays Portia as the mother from the  Sense & SensibilityLike many BBC Shakespeares the faces don't seem right for a few minutes  Hollywood spoils us with pitch perfect prototypes  But after they settle in the language takes over  The play itself is very powerful and maybe the best the actors can do is not get in its wayI was deeply moved by the court scene  The theme of mercy over justice (though it is bittersweet considering Shylock's end) has seldom found better expressionA funny thing:  the sound of the music being played at Portia's house starts to drag and whine right when Lorenzo is giving a speech about music appreciation  It sounds like a cassette getting half stuck in the old tape playersI do like the Pacino and Irons production a lot too but I'm glad I chose this one to get ready (I almost said "to make ready myself" - it's tempting to talk that way after these plays isn't it?) for class  The less expensive productions seem to let the language through cleaner
5.39  Mr Rogers is still the best His timeless lessons are more important than ever The price is also great Unfortunately the way they are listed on the Amazon site by the Fred Rogers co leaves much to be desired The chronologic listing is very poor making it difficult to watch these in order by week or year The picture quality is just OK Still overall a great buy &#;It's all good in the hood!&#;
5.39  We bought this DVD for my grandchild who is  years old  I am so happy to be able to share the same TV shows that her dad watched as a child  Mr Rogers has a timeless message  The pace of the show is very calming and she just sat there and watched the whole  minutes  I just wish we could afford to get more of these for her  Perhaps the price will come down a bit as more people requests them
5.39  This  disc DVD set contained only  short episodes of mr Rogers on them  episode per disc For $ I think that is a rip off!! They should combine episodes or lower the price significantly The shows are great but again there should be multiple shows per disc considering the length of the programs
19.99  I chose this workout because I love Cathe and the "Low Impact Series" were the only Cathe videos available on Amazon's instant video I thought it would be too easy after reading the word "low impact" but I was wrong-- very wrong This workout utilizes up to  lb weights gliders push-ups and planks The use of the gliders with moves such as the burpee mountain climber and jumping jack uses muscles not normally stressed and you will feel it the next day I am a local fitness instructor and I was having difficulty walking the next day!As for gliders- very expensive to purchase on the fitness side but are available for much cheaper if you purchase furniture sliders at your local big box store I simply use paper plates- shiny-side down- on carpet and old clothing on hardwood floorsOn the technical side I'm not sure why the video "loops" after the last exercise set The workout is really around  min not : but the video jumps back to the beginning after the last set BEFORE going to the cooldown I'm not sure if they are saying to repeat everything again? It is just awkward I had to "find" the cooldown/stretch by scrolling ahead Cathe provides a very thorough stretching session at the end though once I found itAmazon- more fitness videos on instant video! More Cathe! Thank you :)
19.99  I'll begin by saying that I was wrong I'm of the generation that lived and breathed the  Ninja Turtles I first saw the trailer for this cartoon and thought it was a cheap CGI ripoff of the franchiseBut then I watched the first episode and fell in love all over again It made me feel the way I did all those years ago growing up with the Turtles Except unlike the  cartoon which hasn't aged well this show looks and feels fresh The  cartoon was corny and the animation was often inconsistent at best By contrast the writing for this series is actually pretty decent for a cartoon Each episode is self-contained but I like how the build upon a larger story with some continuous characters and elements The action is well paced but also allows time for character moments Best of all the show is genuinely funny Not goofy corny "I can't believe I'm watching this" funny but some real "laugh out load" momentsI think this show has potential to revive the Ninja Turtles franchise I dare say it might even be better than the  series in some ways Definitely recommended
15.84  I watched this video on Amazon's streaming service prior to a trip to Iceland I would recommend it as a "getting started" video for anyone interested in seeing the country via the ring-road It provides an excellent overview of the many scenic attractions in Iceland and was very helpful in planning my itineraryFor planning purposes I think it's best watched with a map I used Google Maps I found the Icelandic names too hard to follow in real-time without closed-captioning There is a menu that's shown prior to each town giving the name and location but it's only shown briefly Having a map that I could annotate and refer back to was a great helpThe video is low resolution and many of the scenes are over-saturated but the narration is quite good It's currently free for Amazon Prime members and is probably worth the rental cost but I wouldn't purchase it The image quality is too low to justify the price and I can't see myself watching it againIf you're interested in buying the film I would try and find it on DVD The DVD may allow you to select individual towns via the menu which I think would be better for trip planning The streaming video doesn't provide any indexing making it more difficult to get information on a specific area
11.12  At a great price (free) ben  Omniverse episode   is as entertaining as the others in the ben  seriesRich in colorfull of humor this episode is a great findThe More Things Change Part 
17.18  I received the package on time and in good condition I recorded this show on VHS many years ago I was glad to find it on DVD The price was right on great deal
17.18  I first saw this show on MTV's short lived series Oddities back when MTV was a station worth watching I really enjoyed seeing this story again I had forgotten how intelligently written it was and so much more &#;grown up&#; than most of the stuff on MTV and still so entertaining The plot can be a little muddy (like a shakespearian play) but if you stick with it you'll get a very cathartic reward in the end I was happy to get the entire episodes and believe me it was well worth the price! I'm Very happy with this Amazon purchase and would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great adult intellectual story
10.65  Love this show!I just wanted to let other people know that this season is missing a few episodes at the end but they're included in Season  on AmazonThe missing episodes are:Episode : "Another Way"/"Ghost Princess"Episode : "Dad's Dungeon"/"Incendium"These are included at the beginning of the Season  download located here:BUHMKI think this may explain the lower pricing of Season  and higher price of Season Just in case anyone else was wondering like I was!
3.86  It was ok For the price not bad
16.5  Seriously this is not a series for those who are cooking on an instant ramen budget (fast and cheap) There are ingredients used that while good are either expensive or rare = you would have to use them extensively to make them worth the costThe tips on cooking things with an oven and stove for the same dish --&#; work already tried them but they do require spending more time and money on your energy billREAD THE EPISODE SUMMARIES Some topics that they go through in an episode aren't really connected so if you are looking for a particular tip or recipe read the summary first then go through the episode
16.5  Don't miss one of the best America's Test Kitchen shows - ever - and that's saying a lot! Between Guy Crosby's explanation of the 'chemistry' of eggs Becky's expert description and modeling of how to expertly scramble eggs and Chris' facial expression upon eating his first bites I realized I have been incorrectly scrambling eggs my entire life and have missed out on the unique texture and flavors that I've actually 'cooked away' using my scrambled-egg cooking method The first -minute egg segment alone is worth the price of this show but you also learn from Becky (the newest young ATK chef) the process for making perfect high-rise muffins from Adam about the best toaster-oven products and from Jack about the newest peanut butter taste-test results I love that these shows cut the fru-fru and get right to the point without the "over-cooked" vanity from many TV personalities ATK staff get right to the point explain in simple terms the specific preparation steps like 'always grease down the grill rack before cooking' the cooking methods and even why certain ingredients are so important In this show viewers learn the 'science' of cooking as well as steps for getting the most flavor from every dish "Rise and Shine" will open your eyes to the simplicity of cooking and ways to harness even the most subtle flavors in any recipe
16.5  One of the price reasons I will probably pay for Amazon Prime is the fact that I can access America's Test Kitchen  I've been watching this show for over  years and just love the chefs Julia and Bridgette are my favorites  A great down home show with excellent cooking tips and instructions  It's actually my favorite show ever
12.03  i remember watching these animations in the 's and thinking they were great_ boy has the art of animation evolved over the decades_ the entertainment value is the nostalgia- don't expect the quality to be anywhere near today's standardswhat i did like about it was the bizarro bit_ bizarro decides he needs a 'Super Powers Galactic Guardians' group for his bizarro world- and it was fun to see the bizarro team_ i'd really like to see this idea transformed using modern day animation tech- and better dialog  but it was fun and nostalgicwas it worth $ ?? NO  these single episodes should be $ or less_ or at least offer a less expensive choice to rent it- i sure don't want to own this- but i wanted to see a piece of my childhood so i purchased this  episode- would not buy more
26.29  Educational safe for younger children to watch (possible with the exception of the dungeon) and packed full of so much information that can easily be applied at home I am using some of the programs for teaching My youngest loves the history parts in the showI looked for it in DVD If you can find it the price is unbelievable I wish they would put it DVD at a reasonable price
20.25  Love this movie! good price for a Thomas the Train movie Kids will enjoy this movie if they enjoy Thomas
56.49  This is my  year old son's favorite show and he loved the Christmas episode! Highly recommended and the price is great too!
56.49  My daughter was driving me crazy about watching this show  I know the positive problem solving skills of Ryder and his team of pups is well developed and engaging so I gave in and bought an episodeShe loved itThe streaming was beautifulPer episode is an expensive proposition when purchasing this show but I had a moment of weakness
19.5  As a big Doctor Who fan I loved the story and even the idea of an animated DoctorAnd the concept story writing and directing of the story were every bit of what I expectedThe animation however was so incredibly bad that the entire thing was brought down to  a pathetic levelI don't know if the animation was an attempt to be edgy or stylized but it came across as lazy and a cheap way to pander to DW fans  I cannot say enough how badly this animation was doneIf you're a died in the wool fan of the Doctor you can tolerate this but even the hardiest fans won't be able to get past the visual debacle
68.5  My  mo daughter LOVES those videos!! Asks for them multiple times a day but I only let her watch once daily ;) Her sign language vocabulary has exploded since starting those videos I highly recommend I liked Amazon's lower price on this DVD which made me order it here rather than elsewhere
4.59  My daughter loves this collection She watches it on tv a lot and always enjoys it So when I saw this collection for the bargain price I immediately purchased it Great value for  episodes!!
25.12  Does not play in all dvd players Only plays in cheap dvd players Great dvd other wiseMy daughter loves it
25.12  My daughter loves the music and show!! Great price as well so happy it's included in prime access to all the ahows!
25.12  My children ( &  years old) really enjoy this program  My children do not watch very many television programs due to the intense dramatic content which really upsets them  This program is tame enough for them to enjoyIt would be great if amazonPrime add the rest of the available seasons to their line of no additional cost programing
25.12  My son absolutely loves Bubble Guppies and I like it too It is extremely colorful and the songs are so cute! I am extremely disappointed in this dvd For the price I certainly wasn't expecting two seasons (or even one) but I expected something like the other Nickelodeon dvd's at this price point- episodes I can't believe I only got  episodes and the movie that they show quite frequently on tv (The only good part of the movie is Wanda Sykes voicing the witch) It is just not as cute as the regular shows I feel like I got ripped off They should have marketed this as the movie with extra features instead of making it seem like it was a compilation of episodes
25.12  My kids watch prime all the time I don't know what I did with out it With that said the price has increased But still a very good deal
25.12  My daughter loves the bubble guppies  This DVD is a great price and offers engaging episodes that will educate and entertain at the same time
25.12  worked well  easy to use price is good the kids loved it  cant get any better  
25.12  Love it just wish season  didn't cost so much I think we've all even learned most of the songs they sing
25.12  It is a brand new dvd in perfect condition at a great price and shipping was fast My daughter is going to love this

25.12  My son is a huge fan of the Bubble Guppies  For those of you not familiar Bubble Guppies is a visually high quality CGI cartoon full of music and dancing (as are most Nickelodeon shows) and has fun preschool to K oriented learning lessons (more similar to the level of the PBS shows like Cat in the Hat Super Why! and Dinosaur Train that he loves)  While he loves the shows on the DVD I was disappointed in the amount of content at this price point  My fault for being thrilled to finally see a BG dvd and purchasing it without a content review  The dvd consists of a short "movie" two episodes which are short in length and music videos two of which have "karaoke" (for those of you who are older think Mitch Mitchell and the bouncing ball nee a fish here)  The video portion is a nice bonus to have as the songs are super catchy with the "dance" routines It would have been a great option to be able to show these on a loop  The songs chosen for the "karaoke" portion could have been better choices - ones that have lessons and a variety of words rather than the choice "I am Mean" -- not necessarily the repeat message I want to imprint into my son's head  In retrospect I should have foregone the impulse purchase (I picked it up off the shelf on the latest shopping trip) and opted for the download of the episodes available on Amazon or Itunes -- both for the price point and the content offered
25.12  My son loves the Bubble Guppies so when we were looking for some movies for our plane ride I was thrilled to find the dvd  He doesn't attend to the movie quiet like he does with all of the episodes on our DVR but he loves any episode that has Bubble puppy! I highly recommend this show to anyone with a young child looking for an educational show that doesn't make you want to pull your hair out!There are a lot of reviews from people saying that they wanted more episodes but I was never confused about what was on the disc  It clearly states on the back of the DVD package which episodes are on the DVD which is more than I can say for the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse DVDs I was looking at Mickey was the same price and only  minutes compared to  minutes of Bubble Guppies! I do agree I want more videos!
25.12  I had never bought video files online before but for the price I just couldn't pass it up  My toddler was teething and very fussy and just couldn't get comfortable at night Since Bubble guppies aren't yet on DVD there was no way to pop in a dvd for her She kept asking for "GUPAGEES" (that's what she calls it) so I ordered this and set my laptop next to the bed It worked like a charm!! Definitely worth the money for that relief for both baby and mommy ;)
25.12  my grandson loves this show and watches it all the time he is very happy with it good price fun for the kids
13.3  So is this part of a prompt to make me cancel my prime membership? You increase the price by % then you eliminate most of the stuff I have been watching? Loosing this type of content not available elsewhere is what made me keep my account Now you're no better than the competition well with less content you're actually worse Please add unique content back!
13.3  My daughter loves this show She is learning so much from watching itI just wish it was available in DVD at a price someone could affordUntil then we will keep watching it over and over again
13.3  Besides being a master entertainer and thorough scientist Alton is an easy-to-follow instructor of his recipes With both episodes of &#;Tender is the Loin&#; he turns an expensive cut of beef into several &#;affordable&#; meals Tonight my  grand kids not only enjoyed the pyrotechnics of the fire show making the filet mignon sauce but the plates of every single one of them including my daughter and wife was wiped clean with the last morsel of meat! Don't think that's all they had: gravy from rendered fat from the &#;chain&#; (and earlier bacon fat) on Yukon Gold &#;smashed&#; potatoes - skin on asparagus tips and a fruit bowl of strawberries pineapple and blueberries Truly gratifying to a grandfather/cook to watch it disappear Thanks Alton!
13.0  Series has good storyline but a lot of fan service If you're planning on getting the series I suggest you get the standard version I had major technical issues with episode  and  of the HD version Bought the HD version do to it being the same price as the standard Awesome series hope they continue with season  :)
11.7  The price for this is for the single episode not the entire season  You are better off buying the entire season from Disney than being gouged episode at a time  Frustrating
11.7  My son loves Jake this show is too cute the HD comes in great! Love the price you pay to own it much better than going to buy it as a dvd We watch this one whenever my son needs his pirate fix and it's not on disney jr
11.7  Great for my Kindergarten class  They're singing along with classical music by the end of each episode!  Pricey but can you really put a price on your child's mind?
11.7  Was excited that this series became available on Amazon but so disappointed in the price My grandson loves them but at $ each show it is a high price to pay for an entire season
11.7  This is a really cute kids show and I think it is a nice break from Yo Gabba and Bubble Guppies in our house  My only complaint would be the cost per episode  YIKES (the season forget it)
11.7  for s st for sd quality and and price my boy love loved it and will  be buying another ep be buying another episode soon
11.7  My  year old son loves Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and asks to watch it all the time After watching the same episode a couple of times he &#;interacts&#; with Mickey and friends by answering the questions that are asked I particularly like that sometimes the kids are told to stand up and march or some similar physical activity I only wish they sold the DVDs as an actual season rather than each episode on an individual DVD I also wish the Amazon download supported more tablets so I could download the episodes to the very cheap tablet my son uses rather than having to stream it from the internet
11.7  My son has autism and is completely obsessed with Mickey Mouse Clubhouse  It is the only animation I can get him to watch  I love downloading his favorite episodes to my kindle  The autism causes my son to have a very hard time sleeping so I let him watch his Mickey while lying in bed  He falls asleep before the episode is over!  No more scratched DVDs  No more buying an expensive DVD for only  or  episodes he likes  A $ episode he wants makes a great reward too!
11.7  My son likes the cartoon but the price is too high  The length of time is to low  I expected a movie  This was too expensive and Disney is a big rip off
11.7  it is absolutely ridiculous that there is not a discounted entire season price for this like there is for hundreds of other TV shows on Amazon I don't know if it's Amazon or Disney making that decision but there is no way I'm paying $ per episode for - episodes per season That's ridiculous! I was considering buying each full season to get some variety since On Demand is not getting many these days but now I don't know if I will purchase any more than the three I already bought purely on principle
11.7  too expensive for very short film
11.7  It was nice to be able to buy only one episode- cost for the entire season was too much for what I needed The one program was about treasure hunting and went well with Jake the never land pirate Very entertaining and educational I missed the hot diggity dog dance
11.7  I have a three-year old and she has always been addicted to Mickey Mouse Its nice to have individual episodes available but they are bit pricey Retail stores have several episodes for the price of two or three here
11.7  My four year old son really likes Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and I would love to own this season or any other but there is no deal for buying the whole season it is still a  per episode Which I feel is kinda of a ridicules price for an half hour show But as I stated my son likes them and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is a really good series that's why I gave four stars It would be five if they made them a little more affordable
11.7  Love mickey mouse! :) great price as well! My  year old loves it He's been watching it since he was  years old
11.7  Kids love this movie no matter how many times they watch it! At a great price and accessible! Love it :)
11.2  Andrew was a TRUTH SEEKER no matter what the personal cost to him He took threats attacks etc to only mean he was getting closer to truth and it made him fight all the harder and dig all the deeper to learn what it is people in government were trying to hide from us the voters for whom they work! I am forever changed by Andrew and his spirit fights on in many of us This movie tells a lot of his story how he worked inspired and led a movement that outlives him today and forever more
11.2  Hating Breitbart is especially relevant today given the way the press core is playing catch up on the stories behind several poltical scandals It captures Breitbart's inspiring dedication to exposing truths - and the ultimate price he paid for itThis extremely well-done documentary clearly cronicles how media biases denied us several truths It is not about whether you agree or disagree with Breitbart's politics it's about his struggle to expose falsehoods It's about the concerted efforts to silence himThe film is both informative and fascinating because it tracks how political biases of news gathers kept them from even considering the validty of his evidenceI'm thankful that this film allows me to know Breitbart's story - which is one that has profound implications for all who cherish freedom of speech
11.2  Well worth the price of admission and the time invested A clear depiction of all that is wrong with the coverage of today's news from media outlets  The movie proves Breitbart's point that it is the individual's responsibility to research and investigate "the truth claims" on every side of an issue The assumptive language used and the manipulation of the facts by today's media can often lead the individual to false and damaging conclusions not based on the full context of an event or issue  Everyone with a ounce of reason and some common sense can detect the errors Thank you Anthony Marcus for a fine film that every American should view
11.2  Soyou probably shouldn't take my review into consideration BUT I'M WRITING IT ANYWAYS And here you are still reading As long as we're on the same page hereNo matter how terrible it is I'm a SUCKER for crossovers Love them I love Generator Rex Everything about that show is unique and fresh The same can be said about Ben 's second incarnation However I'm not a big fan of Ultimate Alien (or whatever the nd series is called) I prefer the original BUT! I did find myself LOVING this crossover special Andowning it at only $ ($ for HD) you really can't go wrong Even if you don't like it Maybe Nickelodeon can take a clue with this cross over's price and lower Turtles Forever Again I LOVE crossovers and I LOVE ALL the TMNT tv incarnations But $ is WAY too much for an hour long special
11.2  I'm not sure why they stopped producing DVDs of GENERATOR REX after the release ofGenerator Rex Vol  Low sales? I dunno At least further episodes are available for viewing on Amazon Instant Video if you care to pay the price (Not me) However this Cartoon Network crossover - BEN /GENERATOR REX: HEROES UNITED - is worth your $ if you'd rather not wait until Cartoon Network rebroadcasts it For those curious the special running  minutes originally aired in  as an extended episode of the third season of GENERATOR REXSome background: Five years ago nanites were released into the atmosphere and infected nearly every living thing on the planet The nanites once randomly activated mutate their hosts into berserk monsters called EVOs ("Exponentially Variegated Organism") Latino teenager Rex Salazar is one of the very few who observes such control over his nanites that he can at will manifest bio-mechanical tools and weapons from his limbs Recruited into the international agency known as Providence Generator Rex seeks to quell the rampant EVO incursionWhen a space/time rift cracks opens over Manhattan a mysterious new threat emerges to challenge Rex: a powerful artificial intelligence that victimizes EVOs and absorbs their nanites Luckily someone else came thru the rift: Ben Tennison a teenager from a parallel Earth Ben  wields the Ultimatrix a wrist device that houses the DNA of a million species of aliens all of which forms and abilities Ben can access with a slap on the wristThis was a lot of fun man Rex and Ben make a great team Sure we get the usual "good guys meet and battle" sequence Rex's metal constructs versus Ben's alien transformations Inevitably they iron things out and go after the big bad assisted by Rex's support crew of Agent Six the White Knight and even Rex's brother Caesar But the huge gratification stems from watching Rex and Ben interact They even shoot hoops in one scene (Rex sucks!) The action is fairly relentless The animation is nice It's not exactly deep character development but Rex does get to demonstrate emotion when one of his friends is seriously injured Ben taps into fan favorite aliens like XLR Humungousaur Big Chill Cannonbolt and Rath (thus spanning the alien call sheets of the original BEN  BEN  ALIEN FORCE and BEN  ULTIMAATE ALIEN) He even presents us with a new alien form (name: Shocksquatch) In final assessment the Man of Action creative team - composed of Joe Casey Joe Kelly Duncan Rouleau and Steven T Seagle - has done a superb job of satisfying fans of both shows Plus it's hard to dislike a crossover special that features a cranky talking ape
22.79  This movie fits in line with a set of others like Forks over Knives and provides an view behind the curtain of how American has chosen cheap meat over good ecology and being good stewards of our land and animals
22.79  It's always good to get a reminder that our food comes from *somewhere* and that somewhere is not just the grocery store Also good to be reminded that often times the price of our food reflects the quality of it
22.79  Great movie that completely covers the issues of industrialized growing of veg/fruit and rising animals  Makes you rethink the real cost of food
22.79  this really opens your eyes to the food system today and makes you rethink what goes into your mouth  the whole food system is corrupt and tainted with poisons and our bodies pay the price along with the true farmers in the country being put out of good work  if this movie along with FOODINC does not change our eating habits and desire to consume fresh local produce that is nutritious and healthful for not only you but the environment as well then nothing willThere is a great disconnect between our grocery store purchases and knowing where this food is coming from and being pumped full of chemicals hormones pesticides etc is alarming to me!  I DEMAND healthful foods to go into my body  Since eating local produce and grass-fed beef pork and free range chicken and eggs I have lost  pounds been taken off blood pressure medications and put my Hashimoto's thyroiditis and IBS symptoms into remission  I feel amazing  I am convinced that I was being poisoned by our food system and I along with the FDA was allowing it NO MORE!  Eat local  Support farmers  Support your communities  You will feel amazing and your communities will thrive and bond**Polyface Farms Inc is doing great things!  Way to go for opening my eyes! Thank you
22.79  Fresh is a fabulous documentary! Too bad I had to pay for it but it was worth the cost because it was not political or biased in one direction Very motivating and interesting!
17.0  I watch with my daughter and it's very good We like it a lotI thought the price was high but there's  show  Love Alice
17.4  I am not sure what rekindled my desire to watch the old Ninja Turtles cartoon I guess it was some kind of cathartic nostalgia involving the old NES games and the halfway decent first two TMNT films from the late 's and early 'sMaybe it was just how ridiculously cheap this season was Now that I am well into adulthood the ninja turtles cartoon is just that much more fun to watch It's ridiculous incredulous silly yet almost always very fun to watch This season continued what the first two did and poured on the cheese with an embarrassing level of gleeSo put on your red orange purple or blue headbands dudes and lock yourself into this totally tubular season of crazy animated fun ummm dudes
17.4  I  like the price of these  always looking for new turtle  movies and shows for my  yr old  this is perfect
29.17  If you have enjoyed seeing the rooms of top designers Martyn Lawrence-Bullard Kathryn Ireland Jeffrey Alan Marks and Mary McDonald in magazines and books then you should really love seeing them at work and at home in this series The designers each have distinct styles and personalities which are on display here  It is intriguing to see how they interact with clients their staff and artisans working on their projects And it's fun to see how they relax at homeThe rooms they design are stunning so it's instructive and fun to see how they start from zero and go to amazing  Season  is as good as Season  if not better  Love watching them travel and shop for clients or for One Kings Lane  It is fascinating seeing their design sensibilities at workI particularly enjoy having them explain their thought processes as they design and put a room together  Would love more on that if we have to sacrifice some of the drama at their homes with kids staff etc  Although a bit of that is fun tooAlthough they work with high-end budgets with $ tables and $ rugs - which may be over your budget - it's great to train your eye with the good stuff as you know you can create something less expensive but attractive if your budget doesn't equal Elton John's for example I am pretty besotted with this series  It's just plain fun  If at times it seems like it's a bit of "egos gone wild" with some of their clients I figure some of that is hamming it up for us  We are being entertained while educated  Decorating shouldn't be all serious  Hope they keep producing this show every year  With four designers and a mix of clients and tastes and the creative design field itself this series will never get dull
29.17  If you enjoy interior design this show provides entertaining and educational insight into some of the design processes  For years I have enjoyed seeing the designs of Mary McDonald Kathryn Ireland Jeffrey Alan Marks Nathan Turner and Martyn Lawrence-Bullard in magazines and books that I have purchased of their work Their rooms circulate frequently on pinterest and have popular appeal They each have different approaches to design and I admire them all It is fun to see them in action  Oh so that's who you are I found myself thinking  The show  features them in their homes with clients associates and with family and or friends  It's a personal look  Obviously the designers probably camp it up a little for the cameras The show's purpose is to entertain as much or more as educate  And that's fine with me I like some froth and fun while I'm learningI have helped friends and acquaintances with decorating some of their rooms I always imagined it would be easier for a designer with more background and a reputation but see from this show how difficult it is even for top designers  When it goes well there's no more fun job as you co-create something magical to delight the client  It's like creating heaven on earth; when it doesn't go well it's like hell on earth  I had to laugh at Jeffrey Alan Marks' comment that sometimes he thought his job was more difficult than being presidentWhat I particularly like about the show is that when you have four to five designers featured and with the different projects they're working on you have several installation days and reveals in one show  So the pace is quick  I also love watching the designers shop for items  Once you've seen as much as they have you know pretty instinctively what will work and look amazing  Yes there is the occasional item you have to return but you have a very clear sense of direction It's fun to see their imagination and design sensibility at work Their eyes are so well trained they spot possibilities  This show illustrates not only how easy and natural it is for them to design something extraordinary but the challenges and obstacles as well  Of course some of the prices of items are a tad jaw-dropping  It's helpful to see high-end items because your eye gets trained with quality images enabling you to replicate the style at a price that suits your budget  Great style doesn't have to be exorbitant  It is still fun to see high-end itemsI like to watch interesting and upbeat shows while on the treadmill so was delighted to find this show via Amazon and could purchase the season for a reasonable fee  This is a real treat if you enjoy interior design and enjoy watching designers at work  Looking forward to Season  of this show  Hope they produce many more seasons as I will never tire of seeing these designers at work
8.88  I really learned a lot from this course the price I feel was a little bit high however there is so much information in this spiritual writing course that after watching I no longer felt the price was to high In fact this course gave me the ability to believe in my writing and the courage to start writing a book that I have wanted to write for many years Thank you Doreen for this amazing course and for being a wonderful teacher
8.81  Longmire is well written and acted  It's nice to see Lou Diamond Phillips back on the screen  Being able to download the entire pilot and first season helped to fill in the gaps while watching season   Downloading the whole first season was easy and the audio/video quality is great  It's easier to rewatch the episodes than through a DVR  Much less expensive than buying a DVD
8.81  A cross between a Western and a Police Detective story it has a unique style that doesn't feel copied  The characterizations are different than typical police shows and I found myself growing fonder of the actors with each episode I haven't read the books but the TV pilot has me wanting to do just that My complements to all those involved in creating the pilot it was excellent and has me wanting more  The cast is super with many recognizable faces including Lou Diamond Phillips Personally I think he is underrated and deserves larger parts but I'm glad to see him in Longmire The pilot is like a movie and if nothing else I recommend you buy the pilot like I did  The cost is low and the production values are high  The writing directing acting and camera work is first rate  I plan to buy the whole series If you like this checkoutTom Selleck: Stone ColdCA Luster
8.81  I love the series and I am so thankful to have this without commercials Itwas not that expensive either Thanks
8.81  Just the photography in this series is worth seeing  It is breathtaking  Wyoming gets a good &#;review&#;!  The characters are real and interesting and how they are unveiled is also well done  Well worth the price and even better because of no commercials!
8.81  I've got all the books and really like all of them  As well the TV series is very well cast and the scripting and settings are very good  It's well above average compared to most TV series  The show deserves all the praiseworthy reviews it's gotten from other writers hereThat said I won't be buying the DVD's (either season  or )  Not at the highly inflated prices you're selling them at (especially season ) besides they'll be available almost infinitely as reruns on A&E;  The price is why I rated this as only  starWhen you get the prices down to about $ I'll buy the sets  That or wait for them to turn up in a pawn shop for $ a set
8.81  First off I've read a few of the books and I really love the character of Sheriff Walt Longmire That said I have a couple of small complaints on the show I'll get to those in a momentLets talk about some good stuff first The plots are well thought out and provide for some interesting twists and turns I particulary liked the outcome in one of the shows where everything looked to be fowl play and in the end the death was caused by a tragic accident I won't give too much away but enjoyed the deviation from criminal misconduct The other good things are the actors I thought they were well chosen for thier roles I initially (after having read the books) had a hard time feeling that Henry Standing Bear was well represented but it all worked out nicely as I watchedNow lets look at a few things that made this a four star show for me rather than a five star show I can't stand it when script writers interject their personal opinions into a show to try to sway public opinion on an issue Within the first four episodes there were several incidents that either displayed an utter ignorance toward firearms and gun ownership or worse yet an utter contempt for gun ownership I sucked up their mounting modern optics on a classic blackpowder cartridge rifle and calling it a &#;powerful sniper rifle&#; Describing the - cartridge as a powerful cartridge that most people wouldn't need Well ok we'll chalk all of that up to ignorance But to make matters worse the producer's anti-gun ignorance came out with the quote about living in a world &#;where anyone can order an AK- over the internet&#; This is a factually incorrect statement intended to sway viewers' opinions and not in accordance with the experience of any rural law enforcement officer First AK-s are not legal without a Class III license huge fee and background investigation conducted by the FBI The semi-automatic clones of the AK- which can be purchased at an FFL dealer with an appropriate background check are not assault rifless by definition but are popular with collectors for a current cost of about $-My next majo complaint would be with uniformity As sheriff Walt Longmire will likely wear some form of civilian clothes as that is an elected position but he may well wear the department uniform too We'll cut him a little slack However Vick's attempt to sexy up her uniform and never wearing the department headgear (a Stetson) may well land her in a bit of trouble Beyond that it looks like the department issues Glock autos so why in the heck is ferg still packing around an antique? That wouldn't fly where I work Even knowing I'm a  guy my employer requires that the Glock  or  are the firearms carried on duty I suppose for most departments these days it is all about liability I don't see Ferg's wheel gun making any friends on the departmentOh one more thing while we're talking about department guns Just who carries a  with the hammer down? Just wondering I'm surprised to see Walt carrying the  in a holster without a strap and with the hammer down I guess that is all about the viewers and all about some serious gun ignorance tooIt probably seems like I've hammered away at the show pretty badly I guess so However I still enjoyed the plots well enough to give it four stars Part of that probably stems from my having been stationed in the Black Hills as an Army recruiter some years back and my admiration for the people and region It probably got an extra star for scenery and the mix of rancher and reservationEnjoy the story but you'll need to wrestle through the anti-gun gun-ignorance portions if you are a shooter Cops you'll need to wrestle through a bit more If you can't take the show do read the books they are fantastic!
18.33  but LITTLE given of actual procedures  processes and &#;stuff&#; used  definitley interesting and worth the price watching tools and food and such worked together from wild &#;stuff&#; and places  again  worth the price  but i had hoped and the taglines had promised more 
14.21  I just bought it and skimmed through it There is Patrick Ford of the Robben Ford/Mark Ford family that originally started the is band back in the 's as &#;The Charles Ford Band The original was the best but this version is just as killer They have of course Patrick Ford Volker Striflerguitar/vocal Andy Just on harp/vocal I believe Dewayne Pate  on Bass/vocal These are a talented bunch don't make any mistake about that I don't know when this was recorded but I expect based upon it's aspect ratio that it was in the 's/early 's There is some great stuff here and I don't know why the reviews don't reflect that It's well worth the purchase price for some killer guitar and harp I dig it
15.8  For the same price that you can OWN most videos you can only rent these for a month Not worth it just because of that
15.9  I generally don't do reviews unless I need to alert about some product or as in this case I want to convey a message to the maker of this movie - GauthamI totally understand that you had to live in the shadow of such an extraordinary being I think u may be feeling the pressure to succeed just like someone born to a president or a world leader or an extraordinarily successful personBut if u haven't had the understanding your father preaches day in and day out; is just because you already know it That is what Deepak does - make us aware of what we already know but lose it along the way in the midst of noise and challenges we faceI say this not as a preaching to u but because my relationship with Deepak's book (and I ve read his one book only which I ve been carrying for the past  years and still haven't read even % of it but spent most of my time trying to understand it) has been of love and hate He was a medical doctor and had to find the answers which the conventional medicine failed to provide and ended up putting them in words For u on the other hand there doesn't seem to be that need to seek So wait until life gives u something that u feel a need to seek that reality in the language of ur father because deficiency (of any kind that intense burning need to know) is the birthplace of a vacuum that one goes out to seek answers to fill those needs Otherwise - u already have the answer You just have to live itAnd in closing although I say that your Dad preaches something we already know it still worth a million $$ to one who had lost his way So I don't doubt the fan following he has although sometime I feel is hypocritical to amass wealth out of it But that is the paradox the undecodable part of each one of us For me it's worth more than the price I paid for it and I guess so is for everyone else who admires your DadEnjoyed watching every bit of ur work! Thanks!
16.61  Doctor Who has been around and popular for ages  Amazon Prime gives me the opportunity to rewatch classic episodes at no additional cost and with none of the hassle with storage or the fact that finding this material is getting harder by the day  I have it available at my fingertips  I can browse and rewatch my favorite classic episodes with no problems whatsoever
16.42  I am so happy with the purchase of this video for my  kitties! It was so cheap and so worth it It keeps my kitty enthralled and entranced She even knows when I am turning it on She actually sits in front of the TV and waits for it to start It keeps her interested and pretty happy! I wish there were more like this out on AMAZON PRIME I can't find any other ones that are good that are offerred in this streaming format Oh I did get another one but it was terribleso glad I didn't pay for the full version of THAT one What a waste I guess we are spoiled after Feline Frolics The music is relaxing and enjoyable without going overboard and annoying The scenes are nice and short to keep the cats attention There are lots of aquarium scenes and a variety of bird and animal scenes It is a very well made video by people who really know what captures cats attentionThanks for such a great product! I will be looking for a Feline Frolics ~ hopefully!
16.42  For the most part my cats love this  If they removed the fish and some of the animals most cats would never see in their life time this would be purr-fectOddly enough the parts my cats loved the best were the blue square moving around the screen the "toys" being dangled on the screen and the birds! the rest they quickly lost interest in Even the rodents did little to peek their interestActually it's fun to watch your cat(s) get so interested in the TV set  The music sucks  I got the streaming version so I guess I'm stuck that that sound trackAll in all well worth the  price tag as I've spent WAY more on toys that they ignored immediately  Streaming makes this even more of a bargain as I can stream it anytime I want with just a push of a button on the remote as to the alternative of finding the DVD and putting it into the DVD player and then taking it out each time I want to play it
16.42  The five stars don't reflect whether I love the video but that my cat loves it I downloaded it because the price was good and I wanted to see what he would do I was watching a movie on my kindle and he seemed interested so I got him his own movie He doesn't bat at the screen or drool when he sees the birds although he did gently feel the screen once He stares at the screen as though hypnotized but he can be distracted from it so I don't think there is any mind control going on LOL Cats like people have different likes and dislikes Your cat may hate it but mine loves it I show it to him on my laptop or Kindle at floor level
7.73  it is now pay for and I will never spend money buying them so change the price or get a  star!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
14.98  My children love this show!  It's fun and very educational for those who love Dinos  I wish it cost less per episode though
14.95  Like the title says I absolutely love this show and as there are HD episodes on Amazon Prime one would imagine that an HD transfer could be done for this show It's also unfortunate that the DVD(!) price is so high for Season  on Amazon ($) but on the Discovery Channel site it is only $
14.95  I like the turtles and have for a long time  This is a good series and I enjoy it  That being said my youngest kid didnt  He didnt tell me exactly what was wrong but it didnt keep his interest  I think it might be the animation  Regardless this is a solid series cheap and well worth the purchase price  It has good stories and I think good animation
14.95  My grandson enjoys watching Ninja Turtles  There are a total of  in this purchase  Good price for all of them
14.95  My son watches this on the Kindle Fire without a hitch  The price isn't bad considering it is a whole season of the show
14.95  I am happy that WB decided to release this volume of "Superfriends" but I can't help but think that it's taking a ridiculous amount of time to get all of the sets out on DVD First off it's nothing but corporate greed that we only have half a season here So next year we will be asked to fork over another $ for the second half of this season just to complete the series Another confusing aspect is that it's very difficult to figure out exactly how many more releases are still coming out Why weren't these DVDs released in airdate or season order? I'm not sure how many are still out there What are the "lost" episodes from that were previously released? Have we already gotten episodes from "The Superman Aquaman Hour" or the "Superman Batman hour"? I can't really tell from the titlesI know that nobody is holding a gun to my head to buy these sets but I am a completist and I do wish to have the entire collection of Superfriends to go with the Justice League episodes But it certainly is taking a very long time to get the set and it's being released just a little at a time meaning the cost for the entire series is really adding up That's the reason why I only give  stars
2.19  My  year old daughter loves these episodes  There are several episodes to keep  her entertained Great price and the DVD came very quick
2.19  MY kids cant stop watching They love pepper pig and I love getting my housework done while they watch and learn I have to set timers now or they will watch for hours! love it! and great price on amazon verus other stores So glad I made the purchase My pre school is learning and my  year old is helping and laughing good family show for kids and parents
77.53  PROI'm only about a little over half way through the rental but I think it was money well spent for the beginner He's clear concise and provides good examples Moves at a good pace as well Was very happy with the way he described the different metering modesCONI don't really have any cons at the moment but I will say the little "half laughs" (you know the universal conversational "putty" that -- in text -- would probably be represented by a semi-colon comma or period? ) between statements tends to get on your nerveseg:::but don't forget to adjust the shutter-speed *heh* otherwise you'll wind up with one heck of an underexposed photo *heh* Now let's move onto aperture where *heh*  things get real interesting *heh*:::Okay maybe it's not that dramatic but I swear it picks up in frequency towards the middle of the film My ex -- a Tennessean -- does it as well Maybe that's why it bothers me so much? Mind blowingOTHER:It'd be nice if Amazon offered it in HD The video quality is fine until he starts displaying his personal images for demonstration The images still get the point across I guess but sharpness in a photography tutorial does matter and it would be nice to see the images as he intendedJames tries his best to stay camera brand neutral but when describing the knobs buttons and menus and their relevance to the topic at hand the camera used in diagrams was obviously a Canon On that note -- this video must have been tailored for a class that he gives/gave because he sometimes references a "class camera" I'm assuming that this was a camera he recommended to his students and I think he even mentions once or twice that it's a Canon Regardless Nikon/Pentax/Sony/etc users should have no problems distinguishing Canon controls from their own especially if they've glanced at their manual for their respective cameraAmazon or James needs to drop the purchase price on Photography  I would have purchased it for $(+/-) but $ must be a typo! Why would I pay that much when I can just re-rent it * times* for less than $?I currently don't subscribe to James' podcast but will likely do so shortlyEDIT:Thankfully he eases off the "heh" pedal in the latter portion of the film
45.99  I purchased it on Kindle Fire for my  year old son This is one of his favorite story because it relates to him  A Mama Flamingo and a little baby Flamingo Video plays well on Kindle Fire The price for single episode is acceptable
45.99  Just another low-quality production from the Dora Empire The dialogue is horrible the voice actors are horrible the animation is cheap and uninspired But my  year old LOVES it! Lucky me
8.25  This propaganda show appears to have been made for an audience not familiar with basic Christian practices and it makes a point of emphasizing the positive social character of Chinese Catholics  Perhaps it was produced for Chinese domestic TV or for distribution as a DVD within ChinaThe information in the subtitles is often awkwardly worded or erroneous  For example it states that Catholicism is known among other things as the &#;Church of England&#;; and it describes the vows of religious sisters as a &#;sacrament&#;While the subtitles sometimes refer to these Catholics as &#;Romanists&#; they are generally not united with the worldwide Catholic Church and the Pope Instead they belong to the &#;Patriotic Catholic Association&#; a government-approved organization which tries to present a version of Catholicism without any bond to the Holy See: the Pope is not even mentioned in this program nor are the bishops and Catholics openly loyal to himWithin those limitations the program may be of interest to a critical viewer wanting to see the state of the openly-functioning &#;Patriotic&#; organization  As a TV experience it's on the dull sideI viewed this program at no extra cost due to my Amazon Prime membership
6.66  Sure it may look like another poorly drawn and trying over the top offensive cartoon but there is actually some deep thought provoking things in the show It really opens up a dialogue about being in an unsatisfying marriage and just staying together for the kids The humor is dark but the real world situations you can relate with are even darker This show is very heartfelt and the animation is over the top Don't confuse animation with the style But having such a simple style gives the animators more time to focus on characters movementsThere's a lot I've taken from this show I wouldn't think it would have as much of an effect on me as it did but there's nothing wrong with that Futurama did the same thingBut don't think this show isn't over the top and funny It's hilarious and weird all the time! The situations are ridiculous and the way they break the forth wall is so cheap and lazy it's almost too much! I love it wholeheartedly!
6.66  Borrowing its style from Ugly Americans is no bad thing This show is absolutely fantastic while the jokes require a bit of a twisted sense of humor if you get them you'll love them I hope this show gets renewed because it's one of the few that I was willing to pay full price for  episodes in
6.66  This animated series by far is the funniest show I've seen in a long time  The idea behind it is great and would definitely recommend it to others the price however is a little high for a  minute show but that's everything nowadays
6.64  You can't tell from the title but you are not buying all of Season  of Chuggington -- you are only buying about  episodes with  stories  Customer Service tells me that is all they were allowed to license from Season   So it's a little deceptive if you think you're getting the whole season  The low price is a tip off that it might not be all the season of course but I'm never sure about VOD pricing  So far my  yr old hasn't tossed me overboard and taken over the ship for this but there is always tomorrowChuggington is a very cute and very adorable and educational cartoon  Highly recommend for kids and adults alike!
6.64  First of all our  mos old son LOVES chuggington! I totally agree with him it's way better than thomas (I find it very boring) but I must say that I am quite disappointed for the quality; why is it not in HD???????On top of it I think it's very expensive compared to other videosThat's why the  stars!
6.64  My son is  and loves everything Chuggington  This is a fun show for him and I to watch together  This show is also a great price especially when my son wants to watch it  times a day
57.53  I had forgotten how cheesy this cartoon was but my kids seem to find it enjoyable and the price is acceptable (free) I don't think that I would pay for my children to watch this
23.65  My daughter loves Olivia books and the show is not on much anymore during her limited TV time  I was happy to discover it free on prime so now she can choose to watch if she likes at no cost to us!
23.65  Grandson loves this and is so easy to order where he can watch on kiddle  or Amazon tv  Another great benefit for being a prime member  Absolutely worth the price to be Amazon Prime Member
35.44  I discovered Supernatural a few years ago and have enjoyed watching all the seasons!  Being able to view episodes from season   on Amazon Instant video is such a convenience  If I'm not able to watch the show during the week I know that I have this option and for a small fee I can watch with no interruptions from commercials  Worth the price!  Supernatural is a great show and I have introduced it to many family and friends - who also feel the same way  It will be sad when it ends after the tenth season next year but it has had an incredible run  I highly recommend this show and Amazon instant video for viewing it!
35.44  This show is epic!  Ryjacork (comment below) stated it perfectly  I make sure I buy EVERY season at Amazon when it is released on DVD to show my support of this wonderful show!Too many networks don't know when they've got a great thing going and attempt to replace amazing shows like Supernatural with cheap knockoffs  KEEP THIS SHOW GOING!!  Do NOT let it get cancelled  Buy the DVDs write the network the producers etcThe show MUST go on!!  If by chance the network wises up and renews this amazing show I will continue to buy each and every season on DVD!If you haven't watched the show please check it out beginning at season one  It just gets better and better!Thank you!
35.44  Supernatural is super awesome!  My daughter is watching it and loved that for cheap she could buy the episodes she needed!
35.44  Occasionally this show has it's moments But much of the time actors just seem to be saying the lines and going through the motions This used to be much better show up to the season five but after that it seems as if creators are just trying to fill air time and collect pay checksThe season with leviathans was one good season after season fiveAnother problem with the show: It's been on for too long and there is a lot of baggage that occasionally just needs to be ignored Sam and Dean beat Lucifer yet nobody seems to be impressed by that Last villain for example who was a powerful magician has no idea who they areIt is not just the Lucifer thing but other things as well Just when you think that top angel is done with another layer of angels is invented to keep the show going Sam used be able to drink demon blood to get superpowers yet now that option does not seem available when dealing with demons It goes on and on like thatThe show has also lost it's flavor Sitting around the bunker of men of letters somehow does not convey the same grittiness and rock-n-roll ambiance as driving in an impala  drinking beer and living in cheap motel rooms
35.44  I love Supernatural and have all seasons Season  only has nine shows and the price is just to high The season is good but weak compared to the other seasons Again I love supernatural but I'm sorry I bought season  just not worth the price If you can hold out for a while maybe the price will come down where it should be to start with Season  has  show season  has  show on and on to season  has  shows All this seasons cast about $ Season  cost over $ I wished I'd waited this one out
17.99  I read Mr Atwill's book recently and then watched the video  The video is a good introduction for someone considering purchasing the book but as a stand alone work it leaves too much information out by touching on the subjects so lightlyThe Gospels are certainly works of fiction; I've known that for yearsand Mr Atwill makes a good case to put a Roman/Flavian signature on the birth and development of the New TestamentThe $ rental price for Prime customers is worth it but I would not purchase the DVD  Get the book insteadKindle format is greatand read it closely  I'm still digesting Mr Atwill's thought
14.67  I bought Watches  and I really liked it I really enjoyed seeing how UFOs and other things that are happening a lot today seem to portray the soon return of Jesus Christ The entire video was pretty good but sadly what I just said I really mean about Watchers  Watchers  seemed to me to be basically a replay of Watchers  with a little more stuff added I am glad I bought the very cheap download version from Amazon to me the DVD price would of been a waste of money
7.26  My  year old was laid up with the flu and requested a Monster Truck video  This video popped up in a search for Monster Truck videos and I selected &#;kids/family&#; as a criteria  He was not impressed with the girls in bikinis and the likeNot bad if you are a teen looking for a cheap thrill from the juxtaposition of trucks and hotties not a kids video
20.44  This movie pissed me off  It started well framed the issues intelligently and put forward a strong case against unchecked reckless money printing by the Fed  Then it just became this ridiculous "buy gold buy gold buy gold" propaganda piece  They show this great chart of the price of gold since  which only goes up  Great  What about the last  years since we went off the gold standard?  It's a complex price history and definitely not a slam dunk for retail investorsAnnoying  This is an important issue and a missed opportunity to discuss it with rigor  IOUSA was better  Watch that instead
20.44  I watched this with some anticipation hoping to gain some new insight into the topic of monetary supply policy and economic stability Instead what was served up was a slanted half picture at best For example the discussion of how the fiat system works where the treasury bonds are issued - the justification offered was that it would pay for services but actually it pays for much more besides; money enters the economy and it does work that's what money does and as it does work it also has the possibility to generate more added value to the economy Even paying for services can add value Alternatively failing to pay for services can lead to even bigger deficits as costs that come from 'emergency' responses or even charities tend to be inefficient compared to government spending Further when it suggested the 'gold standard' was a well developed standard it assumes that gold remains scarce and there remains very strong demand but in reality gold is seen nowadays far more as a 'shiny yellow metal' than as anything intrinsically of value Indeed the current price is governed as much by demand for gold in consumer electronics than anything else Again the idea that foreign currencies buying into the 'ponzi' scheme of US treasury bonds doesn't give a full picture - all countries have debts and the US carries much of the European and Asian debt too In other words all countries owe a bit and own a bit in regard to other currencies In other words everyone is invested into everyone else The other problem I had was that the crisis that seemed to be inevitable was fundamentally a crisis of confidence - of course the Fed would collapse if all the IOUs were to be called in at the same time EVERY bank is like that and of course every economy The real issue is the level of risk a bank should hold a percentage of the total leverage in fixed capital but not whole amount The problem with the subprime was an issue of 'hiding' the risk off books not so much an issue of the derivatives being intrinsically valueless In the end while the mortgage might fail the equity remains the house and this is 'floor' that stops the risk from falling completely flat as suggested in the film Over and over important elements that bring balance and perspective to the economic systems talked about were left out Bringing money into being only devalues the currency because governments cannot control prices and while capital owners and produces can manipulate prices to try to compensate for having a weaker position RELATIVE TO TAXATION individual consumers and workers do not have that freedom and so they carry the can for inflation The main problem is getting those that can afford to pay to actually pay
20.44  I've spent my career as an investor beginning just before the  crash  I've been through some incredible booms and busts  Yet the economic policies we see today have little if any precedent in history  As such we collectively are ill prepared for what i view is the Great Unwinding of these policies  It is difficult to know which assets will be more highly valued and which will get crushed  So we need to hedge in several ways including some exposure to gold  That leads to my review of this showOverall the show should cause the viewer to do more research and understand the interplay between macro economic policies and all assets including stocks bonds currency hard assets  That's the best and only good thing i can say about this showFor starters calling Fed policies a Ponzi Scheme is utterly disingenuous  If anything implied in the show's illustration of the mechanics its Fiscal policy that's become untethered from useful economics ie the lack of multiplier efffect that theory says should occur  It's the growing US Government deficits that cause the Treasury to borrow increasing amounts from the Fed/Bond holdersFurther the speakers completely ignore THE primary reason that foreign countries buy US Treasuries instead of repatriating dollars back to their county  If they repatriate it makes their currencies rise and thus makes their exported goods less price competitive  If anything its those countries who are playing the Ponzi scheme not the Fed  As a result of this trade behavior US consumers benefit from lower prices US government benefits from lower bond costs but US manufacturers and labor are penalized due to less domestic productionOverall the show makes weak arguments scare tactics really as to why to own gold  It provides some basic history on the gold standard  however it never gets into the meat of the issues that could cause a dollar crisis such as the Quantitative Easing policies of the Fed the massive growing of its balance sheet and its dominance of ownership of US Treasury and mortgage bonds nor the incredibly poor fiscal policies of the US government  All these issues will contribute to the strength or weakening of the US $ and to the future purchasing power of US citizensLastly several of those interviewed for the program are biased based on the fact that they run gold-oriented investment firms or media companies (news letters books etc)  As such there wasn't much balance of views among the interviewees books i would recommend to better understand some of these issues is Barry Eichengreen's book Exorbitant Privilege and James Rickard's Currency Wars  Rickards had a cameo appearance in this show
20.44  "If you can't hold it you don't own it"  But is gold really the stiff currency that the th Monkey film makers hope that it is?  With Michael Ruppert of From The Wilderness tauting the story of the th monkeyafter the th monkey is the turning point and catalyst for influending the whole populationthen is gold in serious trouble like oil? As demand shoots up and supply shrinks?  Like Nelson and Bunker Hunt trying to corner the silver market or Kyle Bass pushing to corner the gold market or George Luther Stearns trying to corner the lead marketleadas in bullets during the Civil War  "Will there be Civil War?" Stearns was asked  "If two men are fighting on a street and three are watching two of the three will egg them on  I'm betting on war"  So when bullet sales went sluggish in time of peace lead went into gasoline and paint  Paint That our Civil Defense told us would help our homes survive a nuclear attack if it was white paint  White lead paint Which at the same time they were promoting the MAD theory of mutually assured destruction  That was  years after Europe banned lead-based paint What can we do with gold besides consumer electronics and earrings? Sniff it?Michael Ruppert whose complimentary film Collapse is like this one only he's also selling nicotine through the entire film is setting the stage along with this one for a huge bubble burst Ruppertwhose favorite story is the story of the th monkey says that we will become like Cuba  A nation of back yard farmers who have some gold some turnip greens and tomatoes but only if we're buying gold now ahead of the collapse That's if we're luckyThis excellent film lays bare the gold merchants' agenda and is a must watch for everyone who wishes not to be duped  It's as important to watch this film as it is to know that the father of advertising was Albert Lasker who said "Snowballs to eskimos?  Hell I can sell sand storms to naked Bedouins but I'd rather sell cigarettes to nicotine addicts" And whose wife Mary Lasker on the day of her induction as president of the American Cancer Society said "Al is so smart  His Lucky Strike ads with LSMFT not only boosted Lucky sales after the war but with his astute knowledge of what motivates people will surely help us with our battle against cancer"My only concern is that The End of the Road did not show the middle ground  For example if Americans would demand that Social Security alone be backed by gold and that a percentage of each monthly payment to grandma and grandpa was a guaranteed residual for the family survivors like a K then the AARP and other retirees can be insured that their retirement is safe and that all those youngsters who are working for their share of the American Dream will have it when it's their time to retire  Don't the old folks hold on to much of it anyway especially if the Health Souths Columbia/HCA's TYCO's and other rip off artist are tried for treason and dealt with accordingly thus lowering the cost of Medicare and Medicaid which as we all know the Governor of Florida Rick Scott as CEO of Columbia/HCA lead to a record $ billion Medicare/Medicaid fraud fine before retiring with his $ million severance package?  It will also insure that the paper currency is sound since the bulk of gold supplies will be backing Social Security while the rest the paper stuff with "In God We Trust" on it is aimed at "giving us this day our daily bread"  The paper damn well better be back by your good neighbor Sam or Jim or Festus or Mohammed or Ugurru  Unless you're a Mormon and are betting on the collapse of the economy but hoping you won't have to tap your year's supply of canned goods in the garage or pull out your sawed off  guage when the Baptists and Methodists down the street come knocking for a cup of sugar and a  pound sack of rice
20.44  I caught this on the DOC channel one night  It is outstanding  I think that every schoolchild in America should watch this documentaryI remember hearing somewhere "If the American people actually knew how banking was conducted in the US they would riot"  True  After watching this I was all ready to go burn down the FedFiat currency fractional banking and going off the gold standard have all contributed to what amounts to the greatest theft in human history  (btw Nixon went off the gold standard because the French had piles of our gold dollars redeemable on demand  And they were demanding  Instead of giving the French the gold they were after Nixon just broke with the gold standard  Screw you Frenchie!  Ha ha  Now that act is coming back to bite us )Fiat currency is a scam  Always has been always will be  US currency is only worth something because the Government and the Fed SAYS it's worth something  Take a US dollar and a Monopoly dollar and set them next to each other  Is there any real difference other than the perceived worth of the US dollar?  Nope  They're both just worthless garbage and the sooner the american people figure that out the sooner we can fix the problem  (AFTER economic armageddon that is)Darth Bernanke and his evil minions know this but their scam is so good they just keep it rolling on  They KNOW that their insane policies will cause the implosion of the economy but they're making so much money SHATTERING amounts of money they just don't careGold has been oversold  There isn't enough physical gold on the planet to give everyone what they have allegedly "bought"  That's just paper gold  Very expensive toilet paperThere are other issues connected to this and I wish they would have covered them but then the video would be  or  hours long things like if/when Russia rolls out their gold ruble in a bid to dethrone the US petro-dollars as world's reserve currency  If that happens how will we pay on our debt?  As it stands now when we have to pay our debtors we just fire up the printing presses and crank out what we need  If the US petro-dollar ceases to be the world's reserve currency we won't be able to do that anymore it's easy to imagine what comes after thatI give this video  stars  It's deserving of more really  Buy it  Watch it  Have your kids watch it  Donate a copy to your local school to show to their kids  If they don't like it give a copy to a parochial schoolIt's that important
13.22  great series at the right price! They make the perfect gift for any Adventure Time Fan--my friend collects the funky artwork that comes inside every DVD and I could not wait to give them this for Christmas so they could add to their collection!
13.22  I adore Adventure Time so being able to get at this price and at this quality was great I recommend it unless you are the type of person who enjoys a physical copy
13.22  Oh my goodness Yes I know we are in the internet age Yes I know I can watch on TV but dammit there is not something as satisfying as not only watching a good cartoon on my Tv without commercials put to watch it knowing I gave the creators the payment they deservedHaving said that I am afraid that I am saying that partially out of fear You see Cartoon Network has this nasty habit of not releasing their shows on DvD They tried once with a bunch of their award winning shows First there was Power Puff Girls that was released as this monster of a DvD set that was practically intimidating to buy (both in price and the prospect of sitting for  days straight watching it to get my money's worth) Then they tried the first seasons of a few of their other shows As you know every first season of anything is rocky and lower in budget so I can assume that many buyers like me saw those DvDs and thought "you know I love season  of Ed Edd and Eddy that is when the animation and jokes sky rocketed I will just wait for that to come out seeing that CN release all of Samurai Jack and Power Puff Girls" years later that has proven to be a risk strategy as a consumer considering the sellers are willing to chicken out like that {Even though other smaller companies can still afford a massive DvD distribution if the only thing they can sells is grainy public domain copies of Betty Boop}I will buy this dvd but only in hopes to not only pay the creators directly for their good work but to get CN to give me the opportunity to buy neat copies of their nifty library of cartoons that defined a generation
13.22  I purchased this DVD for the grand kids for the SUMMER when they come over to stay  I thought that it would just be entertaining to the older kids however they all were excited to watch it  The younger kids liked the characters and the action  After having such a great time I was surprised to see that they were watching the same video the next day too  I decided to purchase the first season from Amazon as well  I really appreciate the value as well  Way to go Amazon your price was even less than the &#;well known&#; retailer as well
13.22  I've been waiting anxiously for over a year for this release ever since the first season was made available last summer This is a great DVD set and is worth the (rather low price of)  bucks You get all the second season episodes in great quality plus commentary tracks for all of the episodes! That's pretty sweet for an "Adventure Time" nerd like myself The other bonus feature which is Pendleton Ward interviewing the crew of the show and then showing them a loud video is odd I was amused and it did reveal a few interesting factoids but it was rather stupid to be honest Regardless this DVD release was worth the money spent and I'm so very happy to have it in my collection Some of my favorite episodes are "It Came From the Nightosphere" "Death in Bloom" "Mortal Folly/Mortal Recoil" "Go With Me" and "Power Animal" Honestly if you like AT buy this set!I hope they keep releasing these seasons I will buy the next one in a heartbeat!
9.93  Beyond it's need to say Purrfect! more than the Cat Woman in a Batman TV episode along with any other cat sound they could work into normal speech the story was very unfair to dogs who are cast as bad guys Really enjoyed parts but the story was a bit too much about cheap laughs and gags and never developed into much Sexy cat girls cute clueless boys and teenage girls running around with guns and rocket launchers on US bases on Okinawa might be fun but mostly cheap gags It could have been better
39.7  The description is accurate and explains many of the aspects of sailing for the beginner with pretty good detailIt was free with prime so the price was right looks like  to rent maybe a little priceyat todays standard but would be worth it to someone in the need to know
9.99  If you're a real fan any Yes you haven't seen before is probably worth your time and this set has some interesting moments (for me &#;South Side of The Sky&#; was worth viewing alone)There's a loose quality to these performances - not sloppy loose - but relaxed and Jon in particular is in especially chatty form addressing fans in theaters nation-wide (even calling out requests(?)) as well as a small studio audienceRick's grand piano sounds spectacular in the mix and that's both good and bad here: Good because his sound really frames the mix and his playing is wonderful but bad because it highlight the contrasting lack of color from the guitar and bassSteve plays mostly a sunburst -sized Martin along with dobro and mandolin All are miked externally and in my opinion far too low and indistinct in the mix (I can imagine Steve being the purist about playing acoustic and avoiding pickups but he pays a steep price for it here)Chris plays a Martin acoustic bass guitar that appears to have at least a bridge-based pickup but in contrast to his often dominant electric sound he too is barely audible even when invoking what sounds like a chorus effect Jon strums a nylon string that's completely buried (to be fair who in a rock setting has ever made a strummed nylon string sound good?)Their quasi-shuffle arrangement of 'Roundabout' reminded me of Clapton's unplugged 'Layla' but altered the vibe so much in a way that didn't work for me 'Long Distance Runaround' has undergone so many interesting reworkings over the years it's to me the definitive Yes track and this version works well except for the too-abrupt ending - a short keyboard coda would have closely it out nicely'Your Move' sounded most comfortable because it's always been an acoustic song but 'All Good People' came across as a bit stiff and sorely missed Steve's electric guitar - his solo is practically a fixed part of the arrangement and he could offer up only a shadow of it on acoustic He seemed to be playing excessively hard to be heardJon's voice was still in fine form in  and Rick plays with an effortlessness and sense of exploration that Steve and Chris simply don't anymore with their tendency to treat their recorded parts a bit too preciouslyIf you're a real fan you'll want to see everything and this is no exception But if you're only a casual Yes fan who associates them with an expansive electric arena sound this set doesn't do that legacy justice
9.99  I'm in love with all things concerning dinos and this is well madeSome things are not new but it is solid and well made the supercroc episode is worth the price aloneWell done !
9.99  Gamera vs Gyaos i would say is my rd favorite movie thus far It really focused on the monsters and Gamera and Gyaos really fought it out Gamera vs Viras though i thought wasn't that great Now don't get me wrong Gamera is awesome but Viras was kinda of a trash monster I didn't like it to much But its still a good buy two Gamera movies for the price of one! You got my vote
9.99  *Contains Minor Spoilers*The Films:Gamera Vs Gyaos:Gamera Vs Gyaos is probably the dullest of the original eight Gamera films but that still makes it a pretty entertaining movie overall  There isn't much to say about this film except for the fact that Gamera battles a giant bat that spits lasers which at one point almost amputates Gamera's arm in one rather grisly scene causing him to retreat to the bottom of the sea to convalesce where he can still somehow hear the pleas of children on land!  It's true that between Barugon and Viras these films got bloodier and gorier while simultaneously getting more childlike in their plotting and story sensibilities which contribute to their delirious quality  The suit work in this one seems somewhat mediocre but that could just be the result of them not having much to do in the battles other than spit fire or lasers at each other  There is still a really good use of colour in this film coming off the beautiful rainbow beam of Barugon in his titular outing  Both Gamera and Gyaos have colour coded plasma so we know exactly who is wounded and how severely!  There are lots of glowing coloured lights that compliment some excellent models and sets further establishing the iconic cartoon aesthetic of the Gamera seriesIn each of the Gamera films so far we also get some sort of commentary or message regarding Japanese culture  In Gyaos there is a rather insidious pro-industrial development message  The Japanese farmers are made out to be the real villains here as they hold out against a road building corporation in hopes of getting more money for their properties which the company needs to run the road through  After Gyaos shows up to menace the community the holdouts lose their leverage not to mention their cows and the population gets cross with their business ambassador for being too greedy  As a result they end up pleading with the road corporation to buy their land at the originally offered price  This is a rather repugnant and naked bit of propaganda made more unpleasant by its presence in a supposedly kid friendly movie  At one point the female lead even throws away a casual line that is something to the effect of "Wouldn't the new roads stimulate our community"?  Yes of course grandpa is just a greedy old man who wants the road barons to pay a fairer price to lay a road over their house  How exactly is building a road on top of a community going to stimulate it?  Don't ask silly questions; sell your family home now and do as you are told!  Stop resisting progress!  This is your duty to your country greedy old fool!Gamera Vs VirasDespite the cheapness of the production on Gamera Vs Viras we are still treated to an excellent zany plot and a superb final boss fight with some very creative suit work  The Kaiju that we meet here Viras the giant bird faced octopus from space is also one of the strangest ever conceived for any Toho or Daiei movie  On this film Daiei decided to cut costs by incorporating reused footage from the three previous Gamera films including the first one which sticks out because it's in black and white instead of colour  None of my viewing party could figure out why we were being shown the old footage either and we assumed it was the Japanese boy reminding the American boy of Gamera's history  At one point however the old footage of Gamera destroying the dam is presented as a new plot event rather than a flashback and it was at this point that I decided they were going too dam far with it!  The old footage pads the film by about  whole minutes and in an  minute film that would sour any pus including a giant space octopus!Despite this frustrating frugality there didn't appear to be any expense spared on any of the original material  The plot revolves around an alien species that has apparently abducted and bodysnatched a crew of Japanese men in a plot that seems to have been lifted for a Halloween episode of The Simpsons where Kang and Kodos took the form of Bob Dole and Bill Clinton during an election in order to gain control over all of earth politics!  These squid aliens which are individually about seven feet tall fly through space in a contraption that looks like five giant bumblebee buttocks threaded through a hula hoop  Aboard the SS Bumblerump passengers are able to telepathically summon giant glasses of space juice and octagonal space sandwiches as well as disappointingly pre-peeled apple wedges!The sequence where the two young kids sabotage the controls of a mini-submarine as a prank is an entertaining bit of goofy slapstick  Later on the scientist who built the sub unaware of their meddling allows the gadget wizard kids to try to pilot it which causes them to get trapped under the alien "super capture ray" along with their friend Gamera!  This prank is later used by the kids to resolve the plot while they are aboard the SS Bumblerump themselves to hilarious endsThis film fares much better in terms of its social commentary and moral messages  It is impossible to ignore the presence of the American boy scouts organization here  The boy scouts are obviously a paramilitary organization and represent the indoctrination and militarization of young children  The presence of the scouts in Japan is obviously inherited from the cultural influence of America subsequent to World War II  During and subsequent to Word War II Japan became an American occupied country and this was accompanied by a greater overall cultural occupation as well  The film satirizes this coercive imperialistic relationship by juxtaposing the American boy scout organization with an alien race that plots to brainwash and indoctrinate the Japanese population and use their own powers against them in the form of Gamera  This is a rich cultural metaphor not to be overlookedThis film also features no less than five telekinetic decapitations and a space octopus that uses its pointy head as a deadly spear a tactic which facilitates the most horrific and traumatizing battle moment of the entire Gamera series  I wont spoil the particulars but be warned that it is brutalThe DVD:The quality of the prints and transfers for this double feature is nearly flawless  They are rich in colour and texture and look excellent on any setup  It's a treat to have the original / Japanese theatrical versions of these films in their original widescreen aspect ratios and language with English subtitlesThere are a couple of small mistakes in the subtitles for both films  In the Gyaos feature there are a few instances where a word like "the" or "and" are missing  This was only noticed twice In the Viras feature the person entering the subtitles accidentally included the timecode for the translation line along with the line itself  This was also only noticed twice  Neither of these mistakes are bothersome but I guess it was nice for them to let us know when we are  minutes into the film!  Some of the subtitle translations are also rather peculiar as they sometimes have Japanese characters uttering very American style lines including expressions like "Awesome" and "S***"If there were more special features as there were on the previous stand alone Gamera releases from Shout Factory it would have taken up space on the disc and added a compression strain but it would have been nice to have some of the old gang explain some of the inspirations and anecdotes from the productions of these films even if it meant doing a two disc set and charging a bit more money  Either way this is the best way to see these two films in region one  Overall this DVD is turtletastic!
9.99  Batman: Brave and the Bold I gave the show one star because there isnt a no stars button  I have watched  of the shows now and i cant say i am impressed  The series is not keeping up the Batman look and feel of the last few seriesBBB has the same look and feel as the old 's kids show superfriendsIt is inane and childish  Batman has a running mental commentary in every show  Not to mention that they are all calling each other "Old Chum"The drawing is flat like a cheap old comic book too  I am not sure what they were trying for here but it is not worth watchingPathetic
16.12  This crap video is not a documentary This is a cheap travel video  If I wanted travel videos I'd see a travel agent  Should not be listed in documentary
16.16  From the introduction: "The Hidden Hand explores a new paradigm of conscioussness taking root within humanity"I really enjoyed this documentary While some of the other reviewers have a legitimate gripe in that it purports to focus exclusively on the government cover-up aspect of the UFO phenomenon it nevertheless offers a very balanced and thorough overview Even so the suppression aspect is given ample screen time I think Many of the featured commentators are actually ex-government/military personnel whose experiences while employed within various covert agencies has spurred their deeper interest in the phonomenen outside of those cloistered institutionsThe information is presented in a pleasing format Thankfully the producers elected to intercut the commentaries and other graphic materials with artitistic renderings relating to the subjects being discussed For me this lent a much more interesting and imaginative tone to the featured material Much more so than a bunch of cheap and embarrassing dramatizations or poorly executed reenactments In addition the entire feature is peppered with video footage of UFO sightings labled as to location and dateThe first ten to fifteen minutes of the video consists of an introduction/overview The remainder is divided into more-or-less discreet sections featuring various aspects of the subject:)  First Encounters)  The Role of the Military)  The Phenomenon of Abduction)  Types of Aliens)  Alien Implants)  The Trauma of Abductees)  Positive Contact Experiences)  New York Meeting of SPACE (A support group for contactees))  Alien/Human Hybrids)  Human Military Abductions)  Exopolitics)  Galactic ConsciousnessA favorite quote from one of the featured commentators:"A new kind of openness and acceptance of the unknown is spreading all through our culture and nobody knows it The media still thinks in these brain-dead cliches "Good aliens vs Bad Aliens" when you have lots of ordinary people who are becoming hyper-dimensional beings very quietly in their own living rooms When this kind of change comes to the human mind there's always the same disconnect: the people in power get left behind"- Whitley StrieberA cogent and thoroughly enjoyable documentary Highly recommendedAlmost forgot don't miss the way-cool closing song "It's Hip To Be A Hybrid"
16.16  Out of the  I came away with  that I'd not seen They happened to be creature features which doesn't surprise me I have never sought those out But it was worth the price of admission as one of the  Splinter was awesome! The effects are really spectacular Not talking stupid effects but the 'simple organism' that took over people's bodies animated their dismembered body parts like a mini contortionist oozing all kinds of black goo Very realistic looking Anyway I'll save that for the movie review The other  creature features are The Food of the Gods (giant rats) and Prophecy (weird looking monsters) I fast forwarded through their top  as those were big time films Number  was Black Christmas At the bottom of the list (it was a countdown) Basketcase kicked it off followed closely by &#;The Hunger&#; The only ones that I would think might be obscure to young horror fans: Silent Night Deadly Night (and be sure to watch #) Silent Night Bloody Night Castle Freak Tourist Trap maybe Lemora maybe Night of the Hunter (for shame though but its value would probably be lost on the younger audience) Burnt Offerings???  Don't be Afraid of the Dark? Trilogy of Terror?? These  movies initiated me into the world of horror as a kid They were instrumental How could they be considered &#;you've never seen&#; material? Its more of an &#;eclectic horror mix tape&#; than what it purports to be But hey- it was worth the price for Splinter alone so I'm not going to complain too much I also know how hard it is to make a list having recently been tasked with making a top  list and it was so painful whittling it down to that! Just adjust your expectations a bit and you'll find something I'm sure
16.18  I like the BBC version also but Krister Henricsson is better then Kenneth Branagh Get used to the subtitles and it's one of the best crime series out there This is an expensive way to watch it considering season  is free on Netflix Season  should be released soon
15.95  Pathetic Amazon! I have an HD android notebook and I can't watch any videos you have on it! Makes the price increase really seem worth it Here's an idea hire an IT department Cause something as simple as availability on devices would surely been thought of if you had one!
15.95  Curious George:  There is a nice selection of episodes to choose fromand the price ( additional dollars) is right )  I love watching with my granddaughter
15.95  This was purchased for one of my daughter-in-laws as a Christmas present  She really likes the America's Test Kitchen show but now has a job where TV time is extremely limited  This allows her to see the shows when she has the time  Amazon has a great price for this item as well
15.95  History channel has better shows on Sturgis  But it was free with Amazon prime so the price was right  Don't pay for it though
15.99  This show is lovely in every regard and the Christmas special did not disappoint  I was initially disappointed to find that the episode was not available to stream online but Amazon's price was absolutely reasonable and well worth the purchase  I have no doubt I'll watch this again in future  And as a general note please give this show a chancewe need more like it
9.1  I found Scott Aukerman's Comedy Bang! Bang! as a podcast years ago and I am an avid fan at this point  The TV show follows the podcast's style of an interview show mixed with lots of characters improv surrealist humor and plenty of running jokes to reward the fansThe second season has started strong (probably stronger than the first) and has held up to the CBB brand quite well  I felt obliged to buy this season since I don't have cable and have been entertained for free for countless hours on the CBB podcast  Having purchased it I'd say it's worth the price on its own without all of the podcast guiltAlso HD probably isn't worth the extra $/episode Given the content and the fact that they don't seem to mess with the aspect ratio in SD I'm going to stick with SD from now on
10.19  The Halloween special is definitely worth watching  The Shallow Gravy bit is way too short for the price charged here  We watched it elsewhere on the internet for free
18.93  Love this show! I am hookedI am familiar with the modern orthodox world The characters realistically portray the stuggles of many modern Orthodox Jews who struggle to find their place in a society that has very defined expectations and rules to play by The dialogue and challenges are so down to earth and handled in a way that is respectful of Jewish customs and values while highlighting the price that individuals sometimes must pay to uphold them
18.95  I bought these so I would have on hand several black inks  I put one in and it didn't have any ink  I chalked it up to a manufacture mistake  Then I tried another  Brand new out of the sealed wrapper it had almost no ink  So little in fact that the printer is still convinced that I need ink  I tried turning it off and on again  And I tried rebooting the whole mess of machines (computer and printer)  No avail  Had to order brand spanking new ones at a ridiculous cost  I really hope I can find a place to refill these or this new printer is going cost me a mint
18.95  The science of physics is to this writer something holy about as close to the mystery of god that humans can get with poetry and medicine close behindOh and music OKBut back to physics and the story of one young man named Stephen Hawking soaring above us like a hawk in his great mind but trapped as the sad story reveals in a body locked inside a debilitating and crippling disease  They gave him two years  He wanted to live to write his thesis  Today he introduced the opening ceremony for the Paralympics in LondonA well done TV bio movie starring Benedict Cumberwhatever the star of "Sherlock"  His cracked sweet smile is worth the price of admission
18.95  We are huge fans of Benedict Cumberbatch!  We tried to get our hands on the movie for months before I found it on Amazon  So happy it was available in a good quality and at such a great price!  Can't beat a movie that makes you learn think and cry all at the same time  Best $ spent when I had to keep stopping to answer my th grade son's physics questionsLora Wilder Mebane NC
35.99  This is a cute show My  year old girl and two year old boy like it They are learning about problem solving as well as firefighter things from this show There is a boy Norman price in the show that is frequently getting into trouble so the kids often mimic things he has done
3.59  Appropriate and entertaining for  yr old but seldom chosen over Sophia the First or Jake and the Neverland Pirates Very fun and catchy songs but not many different things going on Worth the price per episode as we don't have cable but not worth much more Nice to introduce children to multiple Disney characters so maybe important in that regard just not a favorite show
6.99  Doc McStuffins is a great cartoon for kids of both gender I love that Doc is an African American female as a strong role model She is very positive during the entire show empathetic and helpful This show allows for critical thinking in regards to older kids trying to 'diagnose' the stuffed animals before Doc figures out what is wrong with them For younger kids it helps them understand what will happen during a doctors visit and gives them ideas of how to take care of their own stuffed animalsI do wish that you were able to buy the full season from the Roku The Roku only allows a per episode purchase which results in a higher price paid for the full season
6.99  My little man LOVES Paw Patrol it really is the only time that he actually sits still  I am glad that I was able to buy an episode for him to watch on our ipad; however the price for the entire season seems outrageous!!  The single episode I purchased was $ and paying that per episode will add up fast as well  I will most likely wait until a DVD with some of the episodes is released vs paying the $$ to buy more episodes on Amazon
6.99  Daughters new favorite show   stars and not  because of price of each show Need package deal for all the shows
6.99  It's easy for my three year old to find and play it!! I wish it was less expensive because it's free on nick Jr
6.99  This is the go to dvd on my kindle for my three year old son He loves this show and i love the convenience of being able to travel and keeping him occupied The price was great and it really keeps his interest
6.99  Forget what you saw in the Green Lantern movie!  This cartoon is true to it's comic book origins  The CGI is perfect for this intergalactic cartoon  The Green Lantern Corps is perfectly portrayed in this animation breakthrough Think Incredibles style animation and quality on a weekly basis That's how good this cartoon is!  This one is worth the price of admission  If you like the comic book genre and a well written and acted cartoon this one is a keeper!  Attention is paid to the character development and villains that are worthy adversaries to the hero  This one doesn't try to dumb down the characters for a young audience Adults and kids will watch this again and again!
39.98  Love Mr Roger's without a doubt but this set is the worst of the ones we have  Why?  These episodes are from very late in the series and the make-believe part focuses mainly on a "Purple Panda" character that talks like a robot - VERY irritating!  My son has a lot of these and he loves this set too but not quite as much as the others  The main reason that I'm taking two stars off (it should probably be more) is that every disk in the set comes with a major skip in it so our Blu Ray player won't even play it - it just hangs about / of the way into every episode  My son's room has a cheap TV with a built in DVD player and it skips on that one as well but the DVD will at least keep playing  I really wish they would fix this issue considering the price of the DVD's!
6.14  We bought this for our Scooby-Doo obsessed  year-old and he loves it Really glad we found it hear because it's a lot more expensive anywhere else and this is much more convenient
20.48  Okay for the people who are complaining about the price of the season and stuff get over it! It's understandable that you're mad since the first two seasons were with Prime Membership but that doesn't mean the rest of the seasons get it! This show is great and awesome for watching with your family People should stop complaining about the price of these shows It's ridiculous that that's all you're mad about That should not be your primal concern Just enjoy the show and move on
20.48  Love the XMen series  Why this is almost  years old and same price as season  season  and can watch free with PRIME membership and get to this season and gotta pay for it?  Almost  year old cartoon and can't watch free with Prime Membership?  Get with the program Amazon!!!!
19.88  The video streamed seamlessly and the quality was HD cable-tv worthy  Was nice to catch up on my show for little cost :-)
19.88  I have always liked the tv show castle now I don't have to be bothered by weather shutting of the program It is a very entertaining show The price was good Shipping was fantastic I would recommend this show The main characters are believably compatible and look like they are having fun
19.88  Product is good but I think the price is too high I would not do again Caught at a weak moment
13.62  There are a lot of books out there that "talk" about pick up from a how to "be" perspective and that is nice but not so effective  I want to be me AND know what to say when to say it and how to do it  These videos are by far the best PU "tool" I have seen and used next to an actual Boot Camp (never been) which can cost thousandsYou get to see first hand how routines truly work and how they activate attraction switches  Truly amazing!  You can stop take notes and process the information at your pace  For the money hands down incredible  There are other programs out there and guys telling you to be this and that (ie alpha male)  They talk about inner game which just seems like mumbo jumbo - if I had inner "game" I'd already be a PUA!They do not give you a system that is tried and true just a perceived way of being  This gives you a system and you actually get to see it in action  I am talking about some really "weak' guys that learn the system and get some amazing real results  Mystery's passion for what he teaches comes out and you can tell he has been there and knows what he is talking aboutI am middle aged and just got back into the dating scene and was trying to remember how I use to get the good looking girls  I use to be the life of the party when I drank so it made sense since it demonstrated social proof  Since I do not drink I really needed a system and here it isI have been watching these videos and reading the book Mystery Method to put it all together and get my routinesI have been out and can see how it really works!  For under $ bucks for the book and videos you cannot go wrong!If you take the time practice and get out there - it is fool proof  A huge kudos to Mystery!  A true Master PUA and human being that has been there!Wish him and you much success!
12.11  Done by professionals in the fieldLike Dr Gabor MateHad all the information I neededThe price is RightHave recommended it tomy friends
25.99  The kids love go Diego go They love Dora alsoAnd Barney  Yipeeeee!!!!  I personally wouldn't mind if I never saw another episode ever again in my life But for my kids it's a small price to pay
6.29  This is a good show for preschooler's The computer game or app is a good one as well Good price for the full season
6.29  A homerun!  Childhood is short and lil guys are sponges so we might as well have them forming their character while they are entertained and amused and that they certainly are by Daniel and his friends  These shows are wholesome and true to the original series they spun off of  The older kids (up to !!!) do not ask for it b/c they don't want people to know they like it but when it comes on for the little ones EVERYONE stops in their tracks spellbound  No one can be interrupted from it regardless of ageSome of the little songs are very useful to pull out during difficult moments in daily life and really do help them get through those growing moments (like &#;You can take a turn I'll get it back!&#;)Normally I cringe at the sight of licensed characters but this is a big exception  I would even love to have Daniel Tiger toys to role play the shows but most of them get bad reviews for cheap craftsmanship :(  Fred wouldn't like that
6.29  Love the show it is my grandson's favorite  When we started streaming it we had problems instantly  It was very choppy start and stop wait several seconds and it cuts to a different part of the programming  Then I got a text warning on my phone that this  seconds had taken up ALL of the rest of my months data plan and had to stop the show immediately or it would cost me dearly in data fees  My grandson was devastated!  Prime is NOT worth it!!
12.19  I loved seeing this collection of inspirational lectures Bob Proctor is worth the price itself! He is a wonderful motivator who explains the Law of Attraction in a very clear practical manner I have learned a lot from his teachings
12.19  You can't help but enjoy anything Jack Canfield does because he's so amiable and nice This film though barely scrapes the surface of anything important and in my opinion wasn't worth the price of the rental
12.18  I'm an adult I watched this show mostly out of curiosity because this is a spin-off from the famous Dr Who TV series I didn't know exactly what to expect from this kid's show I figured it will be similar to a typical children's educational show where I see Sarah Jane take kids to a magical adventure with cheap special effects learning experiences and some moral lectures to help them live a better life I was wrongSarah Jane Adventures are truly adventures for both kids and adults alike It's not an educational show at all but a non-stop action adventure show that is geared more for the young teenager in mind  In many ways this show is more like a watered down version of the Dr Who TV series except Sarah Jane is her own version of Dr Who that takes kids through danger and adventure But unlike Dr Who all of her adventures are here on Earth not in time and space Her assistance are kids and they feel cool and engaged being with an older woman that can be their grandmother Adults will like this show too because the storyline is more dramatic than a typical kid's fairy tale story All the good guys and supporting characters are portrayed realistically and the villains are realistically scary too but not too scarySarah Jane is the original character from the famous Dr Who TV series way back in the 's If fact Sarah Jane Adventures is played by the original actor Elisabeth Sladen It's really cool that Sladen gets to play her original character in this TV show  I really liked this kid's show and I believe that many kids will love watching it Sadly Elisabeth Sladen recently passed away this year  She was only  years old
